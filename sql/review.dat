80000|shiri|DVD at home|2000-12-23|<p>I started hearing about this movie through references in different articles. This was the top-grossing Korean film ever, though I've been told that the record has since been broken (by what I don't know). No surprise, once I saw it, that this was the case. I was at a video store known for its Hong Kong selection, looking through their DVD list when I saw it. I found it on the shelves and double checked that it had English subtitles (because last I had heard, it didn't). The DVD comes out of Hong Kong.</p><p>This film falls into a few different categories, particularly action and drama. The action scenes are well done and logically flow with the film, but there is also a love story that touches you. The acting is well done and the plot twists pull you in. There isn't a lot I can say about the film's plot, because it is really something you have to experience for yourself. You will enjoy seeing how things fall together by the end.</p><p>My only complaint about the film would have to be its demonization of North Korea, particularly the early training scenes. These scenes help foster a nationalist image of North Korea as a bunch of fanatics, which of course only serves to keep the two nations divided and to further the interests of those in power in South Korea (who have kept the nations divided for a reason). On the other hand, I love the lead male terrorist. He has some lines which really put things into perspective... pointing out the disparities between the two Koreas.</p>
80001|nowhere2hide|Nuart Theatre|2000-12-27|<p>I'm a longtime fan of Hong Kong action films, and when I saw that a Korean action film was going to be playing on the big screen, I was intrigued. I recently saw <short=\"shiri\">Shiri</short> as well, an excellent film that I would certainly recommend, so my interest in Korean cinema is  growing (I think this is about the third South Korean film I have ever seen).</p><p>Like most reviews have concentrated on, this film is a pleasure visually. Different camera techniques are employed at various times, but the stuttering motion was the best... the comic book quality. People don't just get hit, they get hit, they are in mid-air, then they hit the ground. Detectives Woo and Kim are also a pleasure to watch, especially Woo with his gangster thug gait and stoop. The fight scenes, and there are many, are a pleasure to watch, despite the senselessness of the brutality at times. And these aren't one-sided fights either... everyone gets beaten. Also, it was a shame that we didn't get to see Kim using his shinai more.</p><p>The music. It makes this film for me. The Bee Gees tune went so well with the image, and had me looking up the mp3 the next day. There is also a Korean Heavy Metal song which Woo sings the lyrics to at one point and which is played at a couple times in the movie. The rest of the score that I remember is mostly classical music, and syncs with the film. My favorite, which got me to chuckle even, was during the final fight scene. It was a classical piece (forgive me, but I'm not well versed in composers and works), but not your typical fight music. It was more of a carnival music, that highlighted the absurdity of the match. Overall, a great score.</p><p>I enjoyed the plot, as simple as it was. There is a gangland murder and the next 72 days are spent tracking the guy down. Many nice shots of South Korea (Seoul?) as a result of the investigations. You see the crowded conditions under which many people live there. The cops are brutal, and one wonders how close to reality that is... not that I expect them to be nice. South Korea makes it into my radar often in relationship to strikes, where cops beat up workers to smash their strikes and demonstrations, so it seems right on target there. Unfortunately, the Koreans I know have not likely been on the receiving end of this brutality, so they aren't much use for corroboration.</p><p>I'd recommend seeing the film; it was a top-grossing film in South Korea for a reason. My only reservation is on the brutality, which could make those more sensitive uncomfortable.</p>
80002|evildead|DVD at home|2000-12-28|<p>Alright, Gore Classic. I had originally seen this movie, together with No. 2 when I was in high school. I wasn't TOTALLY into these kind of films, but had enough friends who were. My sophomore chemistry lab partner, who went on to art school, was a latex monster master. Another friend wore an Evil Dead shirt on a regular basis. Of course, when I saw the videos in high school I wasn't really that blown away. But, my girlfriend had never seen the movie, so we rented it anew.</p><p>On this watch, I took in more of the humor (much not intentional, of course). I was also impressed by what was accomplished at the time (1979-82, when the film was made). It is slow-moving, but that isn't a problem to me. I definitely would categorize this film as a classic, although I have no desire to own it. My girlfriend wasn't all that impressed, but enjoyed.</p><p>The delight: Bruce Campbell's commentary track. I took the time to  watch the movie 3 times, once as normal, once with the director/producer commentary track, and once with Bruce's commentary. Bruce is a natural comedian, and I was laughing and enjoying the film much more with his descriptions. I know there is an <short=\"evildead2\" title=\"Evil Dead 2\">Evil Dead 2</short> Collector's Disk out there, and I will be sure to rent it at some point; to refresh the movie in my head, but mostly if there is another commentary track to enjoy that.</p>
80003|cthd|Universal IMAX, Universal City|2000-12-29|<p>This movie, of course, has been getting rave reviews as one of the best movies of 2000, and it is certainly deserved. I will be rooting for it to receive any award it is up for. I was anticipating this film since I heard about it around mid-2000, or earlier, I cannot remember. I was expecting a masterpiece and was not disappointed. This was actually my second viewing, having watched it back on December 17 (just before my decision to start these reviews).</p><p>This movie is wuxia in its most artistic form. The choreography is excellent, as to be expected from the greatest choreographer on the planet, Yeun Woo Ping. I am thoroughly familiar with his excellent work already. Michelle Yeoh has already shown her proficiency in this arena, and Zhang Zi Yi's training as a dancer certainly made her performance that much stronger. I only know one person who was disappointed with the fighting in this film, and he was expecting to see a kung fu film (which haven't really been made since the early 1980s anyway).</p><p>The acting in this film is excellent (though my Chinese friends all say that the accents on everyone but Zhang Zi Yi, for obvious reasons, are horrendous). Michelle Yeoh's facial expressions are excellent and adeptly portray the tension she is facing in her heart. Zhang Zi Yi is also impressive, doing an excellent job at portraying the inexperience and lack of confidence of her character, in dialogue as well as action scenes. I am looking forward to catching her earlier films, one of which is being released in the U.S. in a few months. Chow Yun Fat is also proving himself an adept actor to a wider American audience, and I could not imagine a different actor playing Li Mu Bai's role any better.</p><p>My favorite part of this movie is not the fighting, even though it is thoroughly enjoyable in and of itself. The plot and the romance are what pull me in the most. The ending is perfect. The interaction between the characters and the way each develops is a perfect example of how movies should be made. I will certainly own this on DVD when it is released.</p><p>Complaints about the film. I can think of none at this point. Not to say that is was flawless, but damn near close. I hope everyone gets to see this film on the big screen at some point, though I know it is only slowly making its way around the country.</p>
80004|obwat|Mann Festival Theatre, Westwood|2000-12-30|<p>I had heard about this film a while back, as an adaptation of Homer's The Odyssey. I was interested, but didn't take the chance to see the free preview. After it opened her in LA, a co-worker saw the film and said the music was excellent and that I would likely enjoy it. I do appreciate \"Old Timey\" music.</p><p>The music, of course, is the most addictive part of the film. I still have to look into the soundtrack, but I will like purchase it in the near future. I particularly enjoyed the Soggy Bottom Boys tune. The way the music is woven into the story is nice, as well. It isn't merely mood music, as with most films, it is a plot element. It is people in the movie singing, and many scenes revolve around a song. If you enjoy folk or country music, I would definitely recommend this film.</p><p>I have to shamefully admit that I have not read The Odyssey. I am, however, familiar with its basic elements, and this was another enjoyable aspect of the film. When you realize that John Goodman is the Cyclops, or pick out one of the other similar treats, it makes it that much more entertaining. I am sure that I will make it a point in the near future to read the epic poem (I did read The Ilyad a year or so ago), and then watch this film again at home.</p><p>The story is not a deep, philosophical text revealing human secrets, but I would recommend it to anyone up for a light movie. It is sprinkled with humor and running jokes, and the storyline keeps you interested. I have no complaints about the film. I read at least one review which was disappointed with the way people were portrayed (ie, as ignorant or backward rednecks), but being a hick myself, I found the characters just fine and was, in fact, happy to see that everyone in the film wasn't beautiful but actual human beings with all their flaws.</p>
80005|ciderhouse|DVD at home|2000-12-31|<p>When this movie came out, I kept confusing it with <short=\"snowfallingoncedars\" title=\"Snow Falling on Cedars\">Snow Falling on Cedars</short>, and never bothered to see either film. I've now caught this one, I'll have to check out \"Snow\" at some other point.</p><p>I enjoyed the film, though not as much as my girlfriend did. It was a pleasure to see the way Tobey Maquire's character went into the world and learned about reality. I wasn't as personally moved by the \"father-son\" relationship as the writer seemed to intend, and will never think of the movie on that level. I was more moved by the conclusion that the main character comes to, particularly about taking action. That is a lesson that we can all learn, and on that level, I would recommend the movie.</p><p>The other element of the movie which I loved was the abortion issue. I do not think that abortion is a good thing, but I also do not think that social conditions merit restricting a woman's right to have control over her own body. The attitude which the Doctor (Michael Caine) has is close to where I stand, and what Maquire's character comes to understand. Women will have to take other actions if the procedure is not available, and the inevitable result is serious harm to the individuals involved. I thought the movie handled the issue well.</p>
80006|genxcops|DVD at home|2001-01-01|<p>I had heard about this film a long time ago, as a preview on other rentals and because Jackie Chan is the Executive Producer. The title, though, scared me off... I hate all the \"Gen-X\" shit that circulated a while back, and am glad it has disappeared. This movie, of course, pulls in the idea of a new generation, but their idea is different the crap advertisers were selling us.</p><p>The plot is interesting and the action realistic. The three main characters interact well, and you are left wondering what they are doing at times... what is planned and what is pulled off the cuff. The one aspect of the film that made me uncomfortable was the whole conflict between the older cop (Eric Tsang), who brings the characters together, and the teacher's pet cop who is in charge of the overall case. The conflict was necessary for the plot, but it didn't fit right. Maybe it could have been better written, but I cannot be sure.</p><p>My main problem was that the DVD I rented was scratched to hell and back. The main action sequences, including the death of a pivotal character, were all skittered through by my player because it couldn't read the data. I reported the problem to the store, of course, and may get credit for the rental, but I still want to go back an watch those scenes someday. This doesn't reflect on the movie, but acts as a warning to all those out there renting DVDs.</p><p>The Jackie Chan cameo was unexpected, since I had not heard of it before. It was most amusing, with some apt lines that will make any Jackie fan smile.</p><p>One last note... the women. Man, they were fine. Grace Yip was not in enough of the movie. This was her first film, and I'll be on the lookout for more of her. The old girlfriend character (Jaymee Ong) was also a beaut I'd like to see more of.</p>
80007|miracles|DVD at home|2001-01-02|<p>I recently assembled a list of films with Jackie Chan in them that I have not seen. Jackie's been involved in something like 80 films, though some of those are just as choreographer, producer, or stunt double. All tolled, I've seen about 40 of them. Of the ones I hadn't seen, there were only about 3 that I still wanted to see. We can chop that down to 2 now. (For the record, I still haven't seen Twinkle Twinkle or the racing movie.)</p><p>This is a Jackie Chan film, so of course it is going to be enjoyable. I'm too much of a fan to be put off by even the insane plots of his 70s films. The plot of this film is decent, though the whole situation he gets involved in with Madam Rose quickly passes to the absurd and no longer believable... even with suspended disbelief. Some of the scenes don't seem to fit very well, either. One of his henchmen is trying to take control, and the scenes where he is trying to manipulate a rival boss don't come across well, and sometimes just don't seem to be necessary for the film.</p><p>Watch this film for the action and stunts. This may sound weird to those of you who've heard about the film, because most point to it as Jackie's dramatic turn, but that part of the film is not really that rewarding. The rickshaw scene and rope factory fight, however, are must-sees. There is excellent stuntwork and some incredibly creative ideas that I'd never seen before. And these scenes are believable.</p>
80008|buddhistfist|DVD at home|2001-01-05|<p>I go on these uncontrollable buying sprees every so often, and it's the main reason I cannot save money. I recently ordered 4 DVDs online, and <strong>The Buddhist Fist</strong> was one of them (you'll get the other reviews as I get the time to watch them). All I knew about this film was that it was directed and choreographed by Yuen Woo-Ping, and was in fact one of his early movies (after <short=\"sies\" title=\"Snake in the Eagle's Shadow\">Snake in Eagle's Shadow</a> and <strong>Drunken Master</strong>).</p><p>The DVD is of fairly good quality, given the typical problems of transferring older Hong Kong films. For the most part, the picture is clear, with some scratches and some scenes where there is too much or too little light. I was not disturbed by these few flaws. The audio track was decent, too. There are no subtitles on this one, just three audio tracks (Cantonese, Mandarin, and English), but anyone who expects subtitles on a Hong Kong film before the early 1980s is likely to be waiting a while. The disc started playing upon insert, but afterwards I traversed the other materials. The info on Yuen Woo-Ping was nice, and quite informative. I was happy to finally find out who the old man was in a lot of these films (in particular, the drunken master in <strong>Drunken Master</strong>)... none other than Yuen Woo-Ping's father. There were also several trailers on the disc (though they are not the Hong Kong trailers, but ones thrown together by the  DVD producer, Tai Seng), some of movies I haven't seen yet.</p><p>The movie is a lot of fun, and the \"action\" is non-stop. I put action in quotations, because many of the \"fight\" scenes aren't combat but humorous exchanges, such as the old monk playing chess and trying to prevent his companion from cheating. And, there isn't much wire work. As far as I can tell, only a small portion of the final fight has any wires (or perhaps hidden support) and it isn't flying action but one fighter standing upon the other. For me, as one who practices kung fu, I enjoy these old school films, because you really get to see some different styles and forms.</p><p>The plot of the movie is simple. A kid grows up learning kung fu with his friend, who is a monk. When he comes of age, he travels to the city to earn some money. When he returns after losing his job, his godfather (who raised him) is missing. His monk friend, however, is part of the group which is responsible. The main character has to find all of this out while various people are trying to prevent him from finding out about his godfather. Watch out for the hunchback assassin... that is one of the funniest scenes... true genius in its conception, especially if you've seen any Hong Kong horror movies.</p><p>I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys 70s kung fu flicks. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but the fighting is still a treat. I do not regret buying the DVD, and will certainly watch it every now and then.</p>
80009|mafia|DVD at home|2001-01-08|<p>The unfortunate circumstance of having to wait 10 minutes to get into a restaurant which is three stores down from my favorite video store and knowing I could drop the DVD off the next morning without it being out of my way induced me to rent and watch a movie on a Monday night. I don't regret it, though I may be a little tired tonight.</p><p>The story is about three friends who have grown up in the village and pretty much just hang out as Triad wannabe's. They stage an encounter that puts them in good with a Triad boss from downtown HK, and use it to advance their \"careers.. They don't have the best of luck, to say the least.</p><p>The movie is a lot of fun. There were some scenes which had me laughing quite hard. The plot is not a serious one, and so the situations get into the absurd, but they aren't so absurd that you lose interest. Some things are just bizarre, and I liked it. Perhaps there is a bit more that a person from Hong Kong would understand, because I found Grace Yip's \"job\" quite funny, but it didn't make any sense to me. But then, like I said, I don't think it is supposed to make sense.</p><p>My major problem with the film is the ending, which is a wrap from the opening scene. It is almost like you are supposed to take the film seriously, because the final scene really seems to be the only way out for the three companions... but it just doesn't sit well. The scene before it leaves you a bit disappointed, and then the movie abruptly ends. My immediate thought was: \"Did they run out of money. Did they run out of time. Why did the film end here?\"</p><p>Overall a decent film which I would recommend to HK aficionados who want an action/comedy with the emphasis on comedy.</p>
80010|dm2|DVD at home|2001-01-12|<p>OK, I've already seen this movie a number of times. I first saw it in the theater in Chicago, perhaps its first showing there in 1994, but I cannot remember now. I've seen it on video at least 2 or 3 times.  But now I own it on DVD. I put in quite a bit of effort to find this, and then I came across it at random on a website. They've sold out, but it was <a href=\"http://www.pokerindustries.com\" title=\"Poker Industries\">Poker Industries</a> if you want to watch them for it.</p><p>This is considered by many to be Jackie Chan's greatest film. I cannot honestly say if it his best... I've never been one for making those kinds of evaluations. It is definitely a gem. This beautiful period piece has Jackie Chan as Wong Fei Hung, trying to prevent the British from spiriting away the \"crown jewel\" of China. A fun story.</p><p>Drunken style is just a thrill to watch, and that is what makes this movie. There aren't really a lot of fancy stunts, certainly not compared to Jackie's more modern-themed films, but plenty of good fighting. For me, it is something that you just don't see anymore. And, this is straight (choreographed, of course) fighting, with wire-work limited to exaggerated blows (i.e. people fly farther than reality allows for such hits).</p><p>The DVD. I was worried from the moment I ordered it, because I had not seen information on this disc before. It's from China, not Hong Kong, and all the menus are in Chinese. Luckily, I can read enough characters to figure out which was the English subtitle option. The transfer is OK. Nothing spectacular, but better than video. My one major complaint, and the thing I figured I'd get bitten on when I placed the order: the widescreen is not the full, original aspect ratio. What does this mean. It means that if I can ever get my hands on a DVD which certifiably has the correct aspect ratio, I will buy it (no dubbed crap, though).</p>
80011|nosferatu|Silent Movie Theater|2001-01-13|<p>This is one of those movies I have been meaning to see for a long time. A few months ago, some friends and I played Vampire, so I was inspired at that point to catch up on some old flicks I hadn't seen, such as <strong>Near Dark</strong>. Then, <strong>Shadow of the Vampire</strong> came out in theaters here a while ago, and it looked to be a promising movie. Of course, it didn't make sense to me to see the movie before I'd seen the movie it was based on. Then I saw an advertisement that the Silent Movie Theater was going to be showing the original. It didn't take any coercing to get me there.</p><p>I had never been to the Silent Movie Theater before, which I guess opened up here in L.A. as the only silent movie theater in the country about two years ago. It is an excellent theater, and I'd recommend anyone to catch a movie there at some point. Arrive early, though, because we showed up 40 minutes early and were almost the last people to get tickets before the show sold out. They showed three short films before the feature, everything accompanied by live piano. The pianist was excellent, not just to my untrained ear, but also to one of the people I went with, who has a B.A. in music and really appreciates this stuff. The shorts were also excellent, two cartoons and a Buster Keaton piece. I have tried before to find Keaton's work on video and didn't succeed, so this was nice. I'll likely head back to this theater when they show some of Keaton's feature films.</p><p>Nosferatu. This was fun. Max Schreck is amazing in his movements, and the lighting is done very well. The story is also an interesting adaptation to the Stoker novel. One little, excellent tid bit which had been pointed out to me before we saw the film: the woman is waiting for her lover... by the sea. It isn't her fiance, either, who is traveling by boat, so make your own conclusions. The film is also funny, whether intentional or not, at many points. The scenes of Count Orlof running around Wisborg with coffin in hand still make me laugh just thinking about them.</p><p>Any criticism of the film. Well, I have to say that I have not been able to watch a silent film in recent years without dozing off. This film was no exception. I missed bits and pieces of the end of the movie because of this, though I still caught enough to follow it. Other than that, what is there to criticize about this artwork of early cinema. I can think of nothing.</p>
80012|ironmonkey|DVD at home|2001-01-15|<p>I've already seen this movie a couple times, and recently bought it on DVD. With the day off in honor of Martin Luther King, I decided to spend part of my evening in front of the tube. This is considered by some to be the greatest martial arts (termed loosely here) film of the nineties. It is certainly among the top films, and bears the marks of master Yuen Woo-Ping, who I have praised elsewhere (<short=\"buddhistfist\">here</a>, <short=\"cthd\">here</a>).</p><p>This is one of those wonderful films where everything is infused with the spirit of kung fu. What I mean is that something as simple as writing down a prescription is done masterfully. My favorite example of this is in the film <strong>Fong Sai Yuk</strong> where his mother carries a bowl/jar of soup to him, filled to the brim, but does not spill any because of her superior skills, and delivers the soup hot. You come away from this film, not ready to fight everyone, but with a sense of utmost coordination and accuracy. It's the result of excellent wire-work and a playful script.</p><p>Any down side to this film. Well, I'll be honest with you, the young Wong Fei Hung character isn't very skilled. Of course, I am comparing him to such young stars as Xie Miao. He has some excellent staff work, but his body just isn't well trained yet. I don't know what his training is, perhaps he doesn't even know modern Wu Shu. The film is still very entertaining, nonetheless. And, of course, Lady Orchid had me mesmerized.</p>
80013|drwai|Nuart Theatre|2001-01-22|<p>The Nuart has this pathetic little Hong Kong festival going on, trying to capitalize on the success of <short=\"cthd\">Crouching Tiger</a>. A couple films each with Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and Jet Li. I will not complain too much, because Dr. Wai is one of the last Jet Li movies I've yet to see, and they gave me the opportunity to see it on the big screen.</p><p>I'm a diehard fan, so I'm not disappointed that I saw this film, but if you are not in the same boat, I cannot recommend this film. There are many parts of the film where I laughed, and some of the  set-ups which weren't even meant to be funny brought a chuckle. As for the action, it is nothing to shout about. There are some nice kicks, but some of the fights are just too ridiculous to enjoy on the level of fighting. The sumo wrestlers are a good example. They are unexpected (sorta, Japanese bashing aside) and the fact that everytime they fall into something they collapse it makes you laugh. But, Jet's use of taiji is straight out of Tai Chi Master, so it came across to me as unoriginal and unimpressive.</p><p>The plot of this film is extremely weak. When you get the happy ending, it doesn't really make any sense. Most of the film takes place in a story written by the different characters in the \"real\" world. For me, it just didn't fall together like it could. The plot leaves itself open for this a little, because each new person who comes in to write a part of the story does so because they do not like the way the story before was going. But even with that, things just don't work or make sense, often.</p><p>One other thing about this film to complain about... the stuntwork. Jet Li is just so accustomed to wirework by now that he has no trouble making it look smooth and somewhat natural. Everyone else, however, is a different story. There are a couple scenes where something crashed through a wall or into the side of a building and people on the other side are thrown away. Trouble is, each time they do this, you can see the wires on screen AND they don't even fall... they sort of float away in the air.  The special effects in this movie, in general, leave a lot to be desired; it is hard to believe that this film was made in 1996. I think they blew all their money on the last scenes and had to cut back everywhere else. That would be a decent excuse, at least.</p>
80014|dune|Video at home|2001-01-27|<p>I finished reading the book <strong>Dune</strong> by Frank Herbert about a week ago. Although I have never been a big science fiction reader, this is by far the best sci-fi book I've ever read. It is an incredibly well thought out masterpiece that pulled me in from the beginning, with a world which combines many elements of our own with many novel concepts. It was one of those books which you cannot put down, which really says something for such a thick book. So, naturally, I wanted to see the movie. I would also like to see the TV mini-series which came out late last year, though I have heard it is not as good as the movie.</p><p>I had trouble paying attention to the movie. This is just a book that cannot be tackled properly in a motion picture of just over 2 hours. The French film, <strong>Germinal</strong> is the only example of a film based on a very long book which did a good job of abbreviating a text for a movie. Dune is not a good adaptation. I think the abbreviations came in a lot of appropriate places, but there is too much thought into the original for this movie to be comprehensible or appealing to  someone who has not read the book.</p><p>I also have to say that I didn't really like the visual interpretations, whoever they might be attributed to. I've not seen all that much of David Lynch's stuff, but I could see his handiwork clearly, and did not find it endearing at all. I really imagined things much differently from my own reading. First of all, my interpretation of the text was much more of a materialist universe, and not one of telepathy and sound-enhanced gun fire. I was left wondering, since I haven't read any of the other Dune books yet, how much of this interpretation may have come from Lynch's reading of the entire series. I would hope the answer is very little. I have to gripe in particular about the wierding way. I saw much of the combat in the novel as hand-to-hand, and not gun fighting, and I associated the weirding way with hand-to-hand combat (as the movie even does at one point when Lady Jessica takes Stilgard in their first encounter).</p><p>The video cover talks of an all-star cast, but I have to say the acting really disappointed me. Part of it comes from a lack of character development in the film; the deep understanding of Paul, or the way Lady Jessica holds herself, or the mannerisms and actions of the Baron Harkonnen are all aspects where the film could have captured the spirit of the novel but failed. The script, of course, was shit. There are scenes that, although abbreviated, could have been written much better.</p><p>I certainly cannot recommend this film to anyone who has not read the book... you just will not understand so much of what is going on. I also cannot recommend the film to someone who has read the book, for all the reasons I have mentioned above. Sometimes I enjoy watching a film adaptation, not because it is going to live up to the original book, but because you can enjoy the way in which someone has put these ideas into the visual medium. Some movies, like <strong>Beloved</strong>, strengthened my understanding of the novel through their interpretations, but Dune just does not do this.</p>
80015|almostfamous|Video at home|2001-02-03|<p>I'd heard about this movie a little bit when it came out and had heard good reviews of it, but I'm not one for spending time and money at the theater for this kind of film. Given the opportunity to see it for free at home and having no willpower to go out on a Saturday night, I opted to watch.</p><p>The movie was enjoyable overall. There were a number of laughs which were well earned: the story was necessary as build-up and the punch-line made that much richer as a result. Many of the characters were interesting as well, particularly the mother. I personally did not like Penny Lane, though. Her cherubic face only helped fit her that much more strongly into the stereotype she represented. What I mean by this is the stereotype of the attractive girl in high school who looks innocent but is nothing like that underneath.</p><p>I guess on one level I could empathize with the 15-year-old protagonist. He had a little of me in him, though certainly gobs more opportunity as a child. I think that is what also left me somewhat disturbed and depressed after the movie. He really invested too much time and effort into a fantasy (Penny Lane), and then had the fantasy come to fruition in a limited sense by the end of the film. Reality never works that way.</p><p>I wouldn't tell anyone not to see this end-of-innocence film, but it also does not rise to the top of any of my lists. The plot is interesting and even somewhat believable, and of course the music was good.</p>
80016|officespace|Video at home|2001-02-17|<p>Here is yet another review for a movie I have already seen, and several times I might add. I saw this in the theater, and have watched it on video at least one other time. I own the video. I haven't been much in the mood for watching movies lately, and when I did decide to watch something, I just went for something from my own shelf.</p><p>I think this ranks up there as one of the greatest comedies of all time. Unlike so many other comedies, everyone I know can relate to this film. The reason for this is, quite simply, because it is about work. So many of the little things that make you laugh in this film could be straight out of your own life and experience. To top it off, the film is just well done at that. Oh yeah, and I love the soundtrack.</p><p>I'll be honest, I don't know what else I can say. You really have to watch this movie and take in all the jokes. It comes from the beginning, with everyone stuck in traffic. When Michael turns down the music and locks the car door just because a black man is walking by selling flowers. The music is of course gangsta rap. Milton is also a wonderful character, with his mumblings and the way that management just pushes him around. You have to cheer at how things turn out for him in the end.</p><p>I think the scariest things about this movie is how much I can relate to the main character. The desire to just do nothing. I'm so there. And of course, in the end he takes the job I have been so tempted to take myself.</p><p>Anyway, I cannot recommend this movie enough if you have not seen it already. Go out and buy it today.</p>
80017|onceathief|DVD at home|2001-03-19|<p>Ok, to be honest, I really haven't seen all that many John Woo or Chow Yun Fat movies. I've been fairly pleased with the ones I have caught (MI2 being the glaring exception, I hated that trash). I've never been into the bullets and ballet as much, though I enjoy them when I catch them. Once a Thief is just fun. There are many parts which are just corny, you cannot take them seriously, but the hour and a half is well spent.</p><p>The three main characters are art thieves, roaming France and plucking paintings for whomever. They get set up, however, by their \"dad\" (who is the one who trained them), and Chow Yun Fat seems to sacrifice his life to save his friend, only to reappear a couple years later in a wheelchair. Of course, you don't realize that a couple years have passed until after the fast forward.</p><p>I cannot say that Chow's acting here is at its best. Of course, nothing beats the scene where he is in the wheelchair and moving his paralyzed legs. By the end of the movie, I'm left wondering if it is intentional, but it comes across as bad actings when you see it. The plot is simplistic and character development leaves something to be desired, but I would recommend this film to someone interested in the genre. Don't expect long amazing action, though there are stunts that impress.</p>
80018|st2|Video at home|2001-03-24|<p>Well, I'm closing in on the last of Jet Li's movies. Probably the reason this is near the end of my list is because it is not so  readily available. It certainly isn't because of the quality (<strong>The Master</strong> would take last place there), though Jet's young age shines through in all these early films.</p><p>The premise of this movie is very simple. On one side of a river live the Dragons, all adopted boys being raised by a man trained at Shaolin. On the other side lives the family Phoenix, a father who is master of Wudang sword, but unable to bear any sons and sporting a whopping ten daughters by the end of the film. The bandits responsible for creating the Dragon family of orphans is still out to destroy them, and so the intrigue ensues as tensions across the river mount.</p><p>Some familiar faces from the first <strong>Shaolin Temple</strong> movie pop up in this one, so you can expect the same excellent level of wushu. I don't remember the tom-boy, love interest of Jet's character from the first film, but she is both the most attractive woman in the film and the most enjoyable swordsman to watch. Many of the kids imitate certain styles, including monkey, tiger and snake. You get to see a lot of serious and play fighting, both open-hand and weapons. Obviously, part of the conflict is between the Wudang sword style and the Shaolin staff.</p><p>The plot cannot be taken too seriously, but what can one expect with the set-up I've already explained. Jet's boyish acting is also a little unbearable at time, coming across as ridiculous because of how old he obviously is. Despite these short-comings, an enjoyable film, though not the caliber of the first one, which I desire to add to my DVD collection when I can find a serious copy of it (subtitles were sometimes cut off in both movies because of the bad transfer).</p>
80019|9to5|Video at home|2001-03-25|<p>I had thought I had seen this as a kid, but nothing about the movie brought back any memory. I've been wanting to catch this film for a while, partly because the song gets stuck in my head every now and then (I've been working as a secretary, remember), but also partly because of the obviously working-class humor.</p><p>This is certainly a classic film. Simple one-liners from Tomlin crack me up, like \"I know exactly where to stick this\" and \"Did you read my memo? Yeah, I ripped right through it.\" There are excellent stabs at the boss-man throughout, as well as straight-up criticism of the work place. The obvious, of course, being the different work rules and the way working people would start running an office once they take the reigns.</p><p>If you haven't seen this classic of American humor, or don't remember it, then you definitely have to go out and rent it. There's a part of me that's even tempted to procure a copy for myself, but my library is already bloated with copies as it is.</p>
80020|ghostdog|DVD at home|2001-03-26|<p>Classic symphony brought to life before your eyes. I enjoyed this film when I saw it in the theater enough to purchase it on DVD when I found it at discount. This would be my third time watching the film, and I enjoy it that much more. Now if only I could remember to purchase the soundtrack.</p><p>I'm not all that familiar with Jim Jarmusch. I know I've seen a few of his films... I remember watching <strong>Down By Law</strong> several years ago and enjoying it, but I cannot remember much about it. I know there are other films of his that I want to see, but enough about that. I remember first seeing the preview for this film before <strong>Blair Witch Project</strong> (shiver) and being somewhat confused but somewhat interested. When it opened up at one of the artsy theaters in Hollywood and a couple friends of mine wanted to see it, we went.</p><p>There are so many aspects to this film. All the gangsters, stuck in the past, are watching old cartoons half the time and trying to pay off their delinquent debts the rest of the time. They are falling apart and no one can save them. Ghost Dog is, of course, just a wonderful character whom I am pulled into. The combination of urban music and experience coupled with feudal Japanese ideals is superb. Having studied Japanese history myself, I wonder how many of these details other people catch. Being paid at the beginning of Autumn every year like the samurai of the Tokugawa period, the images pulled from a weakening and changing samurai class (for that is one of the marks of the Tokugawa period, in which the Hagakure was written) punch home the point that old ways are dying.</p><p>The friendship with the Haitian ice cream man is wonderful. The understanding of the two and their interaction moves one to both laughter and tears. The bear references, which leads to the beautiful scene near the end of the movie with the two hunters, make the Ghost Dog character that much more appealing.</p><p>I cannot really recommend this movie enough. If you like Wu-Tang Clan and RZA, then you will love the music. If you even know a little bit about Japanese history, you will love the references. The different quotations from the Hagakure almost lured me to purchase a copy when I was at a bookstore a while back. And the rapping gangster, slipping Public Enemy off the tongue like a true fan. The Shaolin master (in  real life, that is) kicking the shit out of a guy trying to snag his groceries. And of course, Forest Whitaker kicks ass.</p>
80021|enterdragon|Video at home|2001-04-07|<p>I got a gift certificate to Best Buy a couple years ago, and the only thing I could think to spend it on was a movie. I bought the 25th Anniversary edition of Enter the Dragon for about $4. At that time, it had been quite a while since I had seen the movie, just enough to remember shouts of \"O'hara!. I've seen all of Bruce Lee's films, and to be honest I'm not very good at ranking, but I don't know that I would place this film as the best he did. Not to say that I didn't like it, I find it a wonderful film. My motivation to watch the film this time: I wanted to see the scenes on the boat as they travel to Han's island.</p><p>There are so many great scenes in this film. His episode teaching a student at the beginning of the film. Many of the set-ups with Williams. \"The art of fighting without fighting.. Bruce's attempt at emotion when he delivers the coup-de-grace to O'hara for killing his sister. The list goes on.</p><p>The thing I really noticed about the film this time, however, was the fighting... or really the lack-there-of. Pretty much, Bruce Lee just kicks ass. But then you don't see anyone else really putting up a fight. This film is more in the American style in that manner, where a hero comes in and wipes out the enemy with hardly a scratch. Nobody Bruce fights really has any ability, at least that you can see. O'hara is clumsy, Sammo (that is him at the beginning with the monks, right?) is just pathetic, and the battle with Han is nothing as far as style goes (it is nice on other levels). Of course, all the other guards that he encounters just get trounced without effort. You can see how damn fast Bruce is, and you see a couple fancy moves, but you don't really get to see any drawn-out skill-fests. That's really more of what I like to see in a martial arts film.</p><p>The interesting thing about this film is to see the time is was made in. Williams is, of course, the best example of this, a strong black man that any hipster is gonna respect after the struggles of the 50s and 60s. He takes on the cops, he is part of a respectful brotherhood of kempo adepts, he has a social consciousness towards people around him (\"Man, ghettoes are the same everywhere.\"), but goes through the women like they were nothing (on a few different levels, there). The script for this film leaves quite a bit to be desired, and Williams's lines, like everyone elses, are too formulaic and expected. This is funny, but not intentionally so.</p><p>I love the film and everyone should see it, if only because it is the pivotal cultural reference when someone thinks of martial arts, kung fu, or Bruce Lee. Maybe when you have seen it as many times as I have, you'll start looking at the things above, but it will always be an enjoyable film.</p>
80022|killersnakes|Video at home|2001-04-07|<p>Actually, to say that I watched this on Saturday is not completely correct. I've been watching this film off-and-on for a few weekends, watching part of the film and falling asleep, rewinding a little the next weekend and watching another chunk. It isn't that the film is boring, it is just that I have been watching it as a way to kill time before I get tired at night. I own the video; it is one of those bargain buys that I got at Blockbuster or some-such place several years ago. Non-descript seventies kung fu film.</p><p>The premise of the film is quite funny. A man who has trained at a temple happens across the path of a fox (in human form) who falls in love with him. The woman is having troubles of her own, because a local snake (also in human form) is determined to make her his wife (I'll let you think about that one on your own). Our hero steps in to help, and earns the ire of the snake, who despite it being forbidden for him to kill a human, especially through use of his magic, decides to do just that.</p><p>This is classic 70's fighting. The action is fast for its time, but the fighting is choppy, allowing the viewer to savor every technique. And, of course, everyone seems to fight at the slightest excuse. I enjoy this stuff. The special effects are quite humorous as well. They effectively pull out of focus at time to allow for \"transformations\" in addition to the switching of camera angles to make \"rapid\" changes. Keep in mind that we have snakes turning into humans here. There is actually one scene where they use a little make-up to aid the transformation from man to snake, but this doesn't even come close to anything like <short=\"conan\">Conan</a>, where the transformation into a snake is low-tech but completely believable.</p><p>In any case, there is no reason to knock yourself out to watch this film, if you could even find it. The acting is nothing to shout about, and there really aren't a lot of flashy techniques to make you stand back and say, \"Wow! I want to learn that!. This film is precisely what I used it for, a way to kill some time.</p>
80023|savagegarden|Video at home|2001-04-11|<p>OK, this is a documentary that I got from the library. I checked it out for one reason alone: to see video footage of praying mantises in action. This basic requirement was met, though not by very much. Of course, I'm not sure one can expect to find anything which just covers mantises without cable and access to one of those nature channels. Why mantises. Because I've been studying a mantis style of kung fu lately, and I wanted to see the actual bugs in action.</p><p>The show is interesting. The premise is that there are a wide variety of animals that live in \"your\" garden that you are probably not even aware of. Of course, I don't know how many people actually have a garden as large and lush as the one Leslie has growing, but that is besides the issue, right? You get to learn about shrews, various insects, spiders, daddy long-legs, bats, and so forth. There is a couple brief sections on the mantis. They are \"good\" bugs, which means they don't consume or damage your garden, but feed off of the things that do. They also have to worry about bats, because one of the main sequences is a chase between a bat and a mantis. The mantis is quite skilled and adapted to avoiding bats, even in a dog-fight, but in the end the bat gets his meal (which is a great shot, I might add).</p><p>I can list a number of problems with this documentary. The script is definitely a big one. It is very repetitive, though a few literary references spice it up a bit. I cannot count how many times Leslie drives home the point that he thought he was in control of his garden, but was sorely mistaken. The camerawork and editing are not to my liking either. So of the shots are beautiful, and the level of detail is amazing. But, it is all clipped and  stuck together. For example, the bat-mantis dog-fight I mentioned. It takes place around Leslie's head. Of course, this is obviously stuck in (without the benefit of a blue screen, it makes it that much more obvious), and although the situation may be realisting, I had a hard time swallowing it. This kind of editing runs throughout, and I found myself glad it was only 60 minutes.</p><p>I did learn from the film, so I cannot say it was a total waste. I cannot say I really got much from the mantises; though they are beautiful creatures, we don't get to really see much of their habits (unlike the shrew, which is well covered in the documentary). I cannot recommend this film, really, though I guess it might be attractive to elementary school-age audiences (who are not going to know who Leslie Nielsen is, though).</p>
80024|traffic|Cineplex Odeon in Santa Monica|2001-04-13|<p>Nothing like a day off to catch a movie in the theater. I haven't been to an actual movie theater in a while, and the fact that I couldn't do anything while I waited for my motorcycle to be repaired pretty much limited my options. Of course, if I had know how long the movie was before I bought my ticket, I might have not seen it, but it was worth it. I'm still surprised at how long the film was, because it pulls you in, and it didn't drag on.</p><p>I'm not sure really what to say that hasn't been said by many people somewhere else. Obviously, I look at this film more politically. There are a lot of great situations and great lines in this film. I cannot say the ending is anything special, at least for the \"main\" actor Michael Douglas's character. The Krushev joke is great, and one that can be used in many  situations. When the daughter's boyfriend goes off on Douglas and says that white people would be doing the same thing if the situation was reversed. Of course this is a little simplistic, but the point is there.</p><p>Ultimately the movie does not address the Drug War for what it really is, a means of harrassing the poor sections of society and criminalizing those who this system refuses to provide jobs for. It doesn't address the issue that these drugs were brought in by the government for the very purpose of controlling social outbursts, and then double up as a way to continue the pressure on those communities after their movements have been crushed. It does do a good job of pointing out how these policies get carried out and the reasons why people take the roles they do in it. Catherine Zeta-Jones's character is great, because you really see how someone can be completely oblivious to the real world, but when push comes to shove, she is not willing to sacrifice her lifestyle and does what it takes to get things back in gear. The point about alcohol is well made as well.</p><p>If somehow you have not seen this movie yet, what are you waiting for. I was just lazy and never had time to actually go to the theater. I'm not going to run out and buy this film on DVD when it comes out, but if somewhere down the line a friend wants to watch this film again, I am not going to opt out.</p>
80025|fistlegend|VCD at home|2001-04-20|<p>It is kinda hard to believe that I have been watching Hong Kong films so much and have yet never seen or owned a VCD. Well, that all changed this week, when I ordered this movie (which isn't available on DVD). I had read about the format and have been told by another friend who has several about the quality. Essentially it is about like a video, only more durable, but with a tendency to pixelate at times, particularly around writing, but never noticably during a fight scene, etc. I am not displeased with my purchase.</p><p>I have seen this movie a few times already, otherwise I would not have purchased it. It is certainly one of, if not the, best that Jet Li has put out. The plot is a retelling of <strong>Fist of Fury</strong>, Bruce Lee's masterpiece, but with some nice twists. Chen Zhen is studying in Kyoto in the 1930s when he finds out his master has been killed in a match with a Japanese fighter. Upon returning and challenging the fighter, he quickly concludes that the Japanese are no match for Chinese kung fu and suspects foul play. The Japanese, of course, are hell-bent on destroying Chinese kung fu in order to establish cultural dominance over a people they militarily dominate. This all takes place in British controlled Shanghai, so nothing is exactly direct. The twist of this movie over <strong>Fist of Fury</strong> (which is exactly the same up to this point in my description) is that Chen Zhen is in love with a Japanese woman. This of course adds to the tension, personal and within the Hua family school.</p><p>The fight scenes in this film are top-notch. Unlike the Bruce Lee movie, where the fighting on behalf of the Japanese is quite embarassing, there are two Japanese fighters here of considerable worth. The old master, who Jet's character knows from Kyoto, is by far the superior, and their fight scene is wonderful, not just for the fighting, but for the lessons it conveys. Wire- work in this film is kept to a minimum, used primarily for people flying after being kicked, and I am certain that is why this is considered by many to be Jet's best movie. I have to concur, since the wire work in some movies does just get in the way, particularly in <strong>Romeo Must Die</strong> where I felt it should have been avoided almost entirely.</p><p>The one aspect of the plot that stood out for me this time was the relationship between Chen Zhen and his school. It is an obvious conflict, and one which can come across as simply the meddlings of the elder \"custodian\" of the family and the \"boyish\" difficulties of the new head master to those who are not atuned to the problem. What I am speaking of is the outright independence of Jet's character, at the expense of the Hua family. I bring this up, because I have to be honest and say that I don't think the issue is resolved well in the film, and my respect for the character that Jet plays is not very high as a result. Of course, because this film is purely there to highlight Jet's talents, one could not expect a more realistic plot, but it is still disappointing. Chen Zhen does act without any concern for the family. This moves the plot along, and Chen Zhen is portrayed with far superior kung fu than any of his brothers for things to develop any differently. But if his concern is for the ultimate well-being of the family, as he seems to assert it is, his actions do not speak to it. The film then resolves that his completely independent actions are OK. I am not putting down independence, what I am putting down is a lack of understanding for what it means to be a part of an organization. This means coming to decisions as a body and acting based upon that, and this is exactly what Jet does not do.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, this is still a wonderful movie, and I am certain to watch it again myself. If you know who Jet Li is and have not seen this movie then I have to ask what is wrong, because you should not be wasting you time with anything else until you've put this one under your belt.</p>
80026|girlfight|Video at home|2001-04-21|<p>I had wanted to see this film when it came out, but I'm not very good at making it to movies. I still haven't seen <short=\"billyelliot\">Billy Elliot</a> despite it being in theaters for about 6 months or so now. Anyway, after finishing <short=\"accidental\" title=\"The Accidental Spy\">The Accidental Spy</a> I went across the street for some fresh air and change of scenery, and <strong>Girlfight</strong> had just started. I probably missed about five minutes, but no more, and there wasn't anything in the movie that didn't make sense because of anything I missed.</p><p>This movie is well done all around. The choreography, cinematography, music, and acting come together well. I found myself very much into the character and rooting for her. There were a number of times when I had to give out a \"Yes!\" in response to something which happened. To top it all off, the movie was realistic. There wasn't a completely sappy Hollywood ending where everything is resolved and people live happily ever after. There are at least three loose ends left at the end of the film, and reality dictates that they probably don't turn out well. The film is also that much stronger for not trying to force the resolution upon the viewer.</p><p>Plot-wise, Diana is a high school senior with a younger brother and a dictatorial father. Her mother is dead, which is something that you learn more about later in the film. The father pays for the son to take boxing lessons, in part because he sees his son as a wimp who cannot take care of himself. Diana, who is a scrapper anyway, becomes interested in boxing after visiting the gym where her brother practices.</p><p>There isn't a lot more I can add, because you really want to experience this film without knowing exactly where it is going. I particularly liked the experience that the lead character must go through in order to learn the sport, because it is something which she really has to work at. There are also a number of well-earned laughs in this film, built upon a solid story to deliver their punchlines. I know that critics rated this film pretty well, and it is easy to understand why.</p><p>I'd definitely recommend this film to serious film fans. I could get into it in part because of my martial arts backgrounds and that general interest in fighting, but even without this interest the film is great. It was definitely worth staying up well past my bedtime to catch this.</p>
80027|accidental|DVD at home|2001-04-21|<p>I haven't been paying so much attention lately to what's been coming out, so when I saw this at the video store I wasn't sure if it was new or a late release of an older film (like <short=\"miracles\">Miracles</a>). I had to look it up to be sure, because the information on the disc was dated older than the actual film (which was in HK theaters in January of this year), saying that <short=\"rushhour\">Rush Hour</a> was Jackie's upcoming American film. In any case, this is Jackie's latest, and I'm glad it is out so quickly on DVD.</p><p>Jackie plays a salesman in a fitness equipment store named Buck. He is an orphan and clearly longs for something different in life. Circumstances twist around, and he comes to believe that he might be the heir to a rich Korean man who is about to die of cancer. Park, the man who would be his  father, has had a long and fruitful life as an spy, and in turn puts Jackie on a puzzle-solving journey to Turkey in order to find his inheritance. In Istanbul, he meets up with the cute Vivian Hsu (cute being the right word, her looks and attitudes are too girlish to turn me on), and something of an innocent love interest is kindled there, adding into the mix.</p><p>Given that <short=\"miracles\">Miracles</a> was the last \"unseen\" Jackie Chan film I have watched, this was a nice pick up over that unimpressive movie. The plot was interesting and drew me in, the locations were great with shots all over Istanbul (and lots of other places around the edges), and the comedy and action were up to par. The naked chase scene was particularly good. I cannot say that the fighting in particular was anything new, since none of the moves really stick out for me. This is more of an action film, but that is the direction Jackie has been heading as he gets older. I wouldn't dis him for the change.</p><p>I don't have anything particular to say about the film. I don't want that to reflect badly upon it, it is a great movie to watch when you are in the mood for light-hearted action and comedy. Looking back on the film a couple days later, I remember the scenery the most, which is filled with old buildings and monuments around Istanbul which I will likely never get a chance to see in person. The twists at the end are a bit unexpected, which is great, even if they are completely improbable. In any case, I will likely watch the film again in the future when I don't have something stronger on the agenda, so I would recommend it to any Jackie fan. In particular, I am frightened at the prospects of two different sequels in the works (<short=\"rushhour\">Rush Hour</a> and <short=\"shanghainoon\">Shanghai Noon</a> are both getting prepped), so a film from Hong Kong is well worth it.</p>
80028|xianu|Directors Guild of America|2001-04-27|<p>I had heard about this film some time ago, at least a year or so. In particular, I remember it on a list of ten must-see wuxia films. I have been looking for the film since then, and had not been able to find it on video (though I know that it exists, somewhere). So, when I came across the listing of movies to be played at the Los Angeles Film Festival, I knew I would have to be there.</p><p>King Hu is something of a grandfather to martial arts films. His films from the late sixties are considered ground-breakers by many, and they laid the groundwork for the flood of kung fu flicks which came out in the seventies. I've seen another one of his films (although unfortunately, I cannot remember its name), which was enough to make me a fan. This film, along with <short=\"comedrinkwithme\" title=\"Come Drink With Me film review\">Come Drink With Me</a> I have found listed as his best. Incidentally, I have not been able to get my hands on this other film, either.</p><p>There should be a warning thrown up front. If you are not into this genre of film, and I mean REALLY into this genre, you should probably not see this movie. I say this because I dragged five other people along with me to see this film, and none of them liked it. There are a few reasons for this. First off, the movie is about three hours long. There is extensive use of long shots, particularly of natural scenes, which set the mood, and the drama builds and builds, but at a somewhat slow pace. There is no dialog in this film for the first five minutes, at least, and when it finally comes it is somewhat startling. Another feature of this film that seemed to turn my companions off: the last third of the film almost seems tacked on. After a colossal battle scene, the male lead, the scholar Ku Shen-chai, is walking off into the sunset and the visuals and music are all telling the viewer that this film is over. But then out of nowhere we are informed that Ku is not out of trouble yet, and then you have a sequence which will baffle anyone who doesn't know where some of the mythology and ideas are coming from.</p><p>The first part of this film is inspired from a story by Pu Songling, which certainly would have been familiar to Chinese film-goers of 1971. Ku is a poor scholar, single, with a mother who constantly nags him about improving his station in life, particularly by taking the official exam. They live in an old abandoned fort, and one night he begins snooping around after hearing noises in the section which is rumored to be haunted. In the meantime, he also meets a man from out of town, Ou-Yang Yin, who asks about the very fort where Ku lives and suggest that the rumors that it may be haunted are true. This results in a quite funny scene where Ku goes through the Taoists rituals, placing one of those yellow sheets written in chicken blood on the post outside the gate, with wooden sword in hand (Chinese undead cannot be attacked with metal, only wood). Suddenly the gate opens and out pops mom and his beautiful new neighbor, Yang Hui-Ching (who it turns out produced <strong>Farewell, My Concubine</strong>).</p><p>Miss Yang (Xu Feng) is, of course, the heroine of the title (\"Xia Nu\" in Chinese, which refers to a female knight, not \"Touch of Zen\" which is a peculiar though explainable English title tacked on). She is superb, and her attitudes and facial expressions throughout the film are a delight. Mostly she puts on a stoic face, and often gives off a look which I can only describe as contempt because I cannot think of a more appropriate word (kind of a \"Why did you ask me that?\" look). Ku's mother tries to set up a marriage, but Yang has other plans, and this is where the plot really begins to thicken.</p><p>Yang's father was an official who had uncovered the deep-rooted corruption of Eunuch Wei, but who was killed by Wei before he could get word to the emperor. His daughter is able to escape with the help of two generals loyal to her father. It turns out that Ou-Yang is from Wei's clan and is hunting them down. The plot spirals deeper and deeper from this point, semi-culminating in a massive battle between the few forces of good (where Ku amazingly proves himself useful, after clearly showing his inability to fight). The aftermath of this battle then leads our heros into semi-retirement, when the big boss-man, Wei's commander-in-chief, shows up to wow the audience with even more violence and bloodshed for almost no apparent reason.</p><p>Another fun part of this movie is the monk, Reverend Hui Yuan. Interestingly, Hui Yuan was actually a real monk, 334-417, who was very important in the early history of Buddhism in China, using native ideas to convert the Chinese population from Confucianism and Taoism. In any case, Hui Yuan is the real bad-ass of the film. His powers are super-human (for a reason, not just practice), though entirely used for self-defense. By the end of the film, he has essential risen above the world of humans and attained enlightenment, which would explain why his blood is golden (a point which my viewing companions particularly enjoyed).</p><p>Well, I've gone into a lot of detail here, but this is a long and complex movie. I haven't even mentioned yet the swordfighting, which is quite interesting. They use a technique quite often where they brace the sword with the their left palm. On top of that, another great feature of this film, which obviously derives in part from its age, is that they use real swords! If you have seen ANY movies out of Hong Kong from the 1980s on, you will notice the prevalence of wu-shu swords, which are quite floppy. These are nice solid broadswords here, and the sound effects of the blades hitting are quite sweet.</p><p>So, to wrap up, I enjoyed this film very much. It is dated, but it is clearly above par compared to other films of its genre of the time. Hell, this film won an award at Cannes, the first Chinese-language film to do so if my sources are correct. The caveat stands, however, that if you aren't into these kinds of films to begin with, don't lose your virginity here.</p>
80029|enemygates|Theater in Santa Monica|2001-04-28|<p>I remember seeing the preview for this film some time back. My impression was that it wouldn't be a particularly great movie, but I was impressed that they had made a movie where the Russian was the good guy. I knew, of course, given the subject matter and setting, that it wouldn't be any different from any other hero flick, but that's Hollywood. In any case, my lao shi wanted to see it, and it was his birthday, so the lot of us saw it.</p><p>The story is a true one, based on a famous sniper of the Red Army, Vassili Zaitsev, whose exploits (embellished by the newspapers to boost morale) lead the Germans to send their best sniper to take him out, since his positive effect on Soviet morale is a zero-sum game sapping the German morale. That pretty much sums it all up right there, with a little love interest and  personal tension throw in.</p><p>The movie is well done, particular from a visual perspective, and the tension of the situation is conveyed to the audience well. Of particular value are the scenes beyond the individuals in question. The battle scene at the beginning, where you see pilots strafing the boats of new soldiers as they cross into Stalingrad and just the extent of the destruction of that city are amazing, and do help to give you a sense of what it is like to be stuck in a war.</p><p>As was expected going in, my main complaints with this film are political. For the most part, the film avoids politics all together. Of course, since the average American doesn't have any idea of the political circumstances in the Soviet Union at any point in history, there are a lot of scenes which probably don't make as much sense to your average viewer. In general, the view one gets is going to be negative, not that it shouldn't be, but there are qualifications to be put upon many of the situations which aren't there (and again, I wouldn't expect them to be there). The down-right worst scene of the movie though, is when the polit guy who has pumped up Vassili in the media makes the claim that \"socialism\" just cannot work because he cannot get over his own petty jealousies. This is the most asinine logic, and really sours what was otherwise a decent film. Coming at the end of the film, it is really meant to be the political jab which the makers of this film wanted to make. It would be amazing, if I hadn't seen it already so many times before, to see such a well crafted film (historical accuracy, etc.) pop up with absurd conclusions. But then, that's what most of the Cold War logic was built upon... silly conclusions drawn from misconstrued \"facts.\"</p><p>Like I said, I enjoyed the film for the most part. I wouldn't sit through it again and wouldn't tell any of my friends that they should see it, but I also wouldn't hold anyone in disdain for having seen it and liking it.</p>
80030|cgs|Video at home|2001-05-06|<p>I have to admit, with some embarassment, that I have never seen this movie before. It is such a classic of Hong Kong cinema, that I don't know how I've managed not to see it, but alas there are gaps in my history. Unfortunately, the store I went to to rent it only had it on video, but the copy was decent.</p><p>This is another <short=\"xianu\">Pu Songling</a> based story, which has been put to the big screen. The story is simple enough. A young tax collector travels to a town which is quite delinquent, but his records are ruined by the rain on his way there. He decides to stay at a nearby, haunted temple in the meantime, not having any money, and use the time to rewrite his records. At the temple he meets two individuals. One is swordsman Yen, a Daoist warrior-priest who has undertaken the task of destroying the local evil. The other is a beautiful young woman who falls in love with our tax collector, despite her duty to simply seduce men so that the evil tree spirit which dominates her can suck out their life force.</p><p>The first thing I have to give kudos to is the definite homage to <short=\"evildead\">Evil Dead</a>. It was first obvious to me during some of the early shots in the forest leading up to the temple, which use the same camerawork, low to the ground but running fast, that mark the beginning of our American classic. Then, of course, the main bad guy is some sort of evil tree spirit, and thus there are a number of aspects to this demon which refer directly back to <short=\"evildead\">Evil Dead</a>. The most obvious is when the tree uses branches and vines to entwine people.</p><p>The movie is quite fun. There are many scenes which are clearly meant to be funny, and even characters which serve no other purpose but comic relief. I'm thinking in particular of the guards in town, who quickly jump on the scene whenever anyone in town shouts, and then quickly proceed to beat on the closest \"suspect.\" The ghouls in the temple (another homage, by the way) also really serve little purpose but comedy, since they are never really \"encountered\" by our hero.</p><p>There isn't much more I can add. Our ghost who is under the power of the androgenous tree spirit is, of course, a knockout. She does an excellent job, and her body movements are excellent. The fighting is never that amazing, but is still quite fun, and I loved it when the swordsman would write onto his hand with his own blood and then begin shooting off fireballs at the undead. If you haven't seen this classic of the Hong Kong fantasy genre, then I cannot imagine what you are waiting for... I guess the same thing that I waited for: laziness.</p>
80031|landnfreedom|Bus somewhere between Oakland and Bakersfield|2001-05-12|<p>I originally saw this film when it was released in the theaters in Chicago. I loved the film then, before I knew that much about the Spanish Civil War, and I have to say that I enjoy it that much more now that I've read enough to know what was going on. The film is well put together and is loaded with political messages. Of course, Ken Loach's films aren't seen by the people who should see them, but by art house crowds, and that is the real tragedy.</p><p>Upon the death of her grandfather, a British woman begins reading through newspaper clippings and letters that the old man had kept in a suitcase. This transitions into a \"flashback\" of sorts, which is the majority of the movie.  The wrapper, of course, puts some perspective on the events and looks at how little we know about a past which isn't so far off or far away from people we might know.</p><p>In 1936, our lead character is an unemployed worker who sees it as his duty as a young Communist to fight the fascists in Spain, who are attacking the republic there. He lands himself in a POUM (Marxist Party of United Workers is a rough translation) militia. You see his political development, the political development of conditions in Spain, and of course the conditions on the front among people genuinely interested in a better society.</p><p>Some of the best parts of the films are the debates. I do have to say, however, that it is because I know what was going on that I can fully appreciate these. After liberating one town from the Fascists, there is a long segment where the peasants and the militia argue over whether to collectize the land, particularly that of the former Fascist landlord. The peasants are somewhat narrower in perspective, but still assessing things from the viewpoint of a broader base than just themselves. The militia brings in all sorts of perspectives, from the American Stalinist who honestly wants to see things move forward but is trapped by his own political development, to the German who has been in the largest communist movement in history and seen it fail because of inaction.</p><p>It is always refreshing to see democracy in action, and not the farce which we know as elections in the \"democratic\" nations today. Most people cannot imagine some of the images we get in this film, where a military officer is elected based upon everyone's confidence in him, and people vote and discuss issues which truly affect their lives. There are rare periods in history where this can be seen, and even rarer moments in cinema where anyone bothers to depict it.</p><p>The drawback of the film, besides some of the limitations that I have already mentioned, is that you don't really see a broader picture of the  conflicts and political landscape which led to the fascists taking power. The Stalinized Communist Party comes across completely negative, without any background, while the POUM comes across as mostly positive. We don't really see much of the anarchists (which played a bigger role than the POUM, for the most part), nor of course of their role in betraying their side. We also miss the fact that they are fighting for a Republic, and not a workers and/or peasant's government. The bourgeoisie is still in there, making decisions, and reigning in the advances of the workers and peasants who have risen up.</p><p>This is a must-see film for everyone. If you don't know anything about the Spanish Civil War, then this can be your inspiration to learn more. If you do know, then you can enjoy a fairly good portrayal of the events. And, if you haven't seen any of Ken Loach's films, get started today, this is only one of his many good films.</p>
80032|breadnroses|Flagship Theater near USC|2001-05-13|<p>I was getting to think this film would never make it here. I know people who saw it in France last year, and I know that janitors involved in the strike got to see it a while back as well. Besides, I'm always starved to a good film which actually addresses political issues and challenges your intellect (Not that most of the films here fit that category). Anyway, it opened here in Los Angeles this past weekend, and I had the time to catch it.</p><p>The events of this film take place in 1999. The main character is a Mexican woman, Maya, who has just crossed the boarder with some coyotes to meet her  sister, Rosa, and get a job in Los Angeles. Dissatisfied with the first job she gets, she is able to get a job cleaning the downtown high-rise where her sister works. Her first night on the job, a union organizer has snuck into the building and Maya helps him elude security.</p><p>There are some very powerful scenes in this movie, and as a drama it is top-notch. The acting is excellent, including a number of people who were actually janitors involved in the struggles of the Justice for Janitors campaign. There is a good spectrum of characters, which bring in the many different perspectives that the workers involved would necessarily have. I was also pleased to see a mix of ethic groups in the job force, with black women and a Russian woman with noticable roles. Because of the nature of the struggle and the way in which it made it to most people's attention, it would be easy to misconceive of the industry as 100% Latin American immigrants, which is just not true.</p><p>The characters in the film come across realistically, and a number of issues which need to be addressed do get touched upon. I was fascinated by some of the detail, like the organizer's apartment where you could see the tell-tale signs of a student who is caught up in the culture of labor without much experience to draw upon. You also see the kind of relationship that such a person can have to such a movement, when he makes a critical mistake that results in somebody getting fired. The film doesn't judge the characters, and so it is an excellent piece for discussion.</p><p>Although not the best film Ken Loach has made, this is definitely a good one. Do yourself a favor and see this film with some friend who have heads on their shoulders, it truly needs to be discussed afterwards, like a good film should be.</p>
80033|shrek|AMC 14 Theaters, Century City|2001-05-18|<p>This film had seemed interesting from the first time I heard about it or saw the preview, but then it took a long time from then to actually come out. I figured that any story where an ogre was the main character couldn't be too bad. Then there's the fantasy aspect, which is certainly enough to make me at least pay attention (though I have to admit I have yet to see  <short=\"dnd\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, given the horrible reviews it got).</p><p>I enjoyed the film, though it was quite short. It really is designed to appeal to a range of ages, so that there are immature child jokes but also sophisticated cultural references. For me, the mocking of Disney films was enough to please me. One of my favorite scenes is when the princess starts singing to a bird but the result is very un-Disney-like.</p><p>I'm not sure that this film will be memorable down the road, but it is worth the hour and a half to see it. The voice acting was pretty good (I honestly expected Myers' accent to get annoying after a while, but it didn't), and the animation was impressive. I liked the grass bending after people walked through it and other little details along those lines. The plot was also enjoyable, with some unexpected twists. Overall a decent film.</p>
80034|leon|DVD at home|2001-05-19|<p>I've seen this movie a few times already, but when my old roommate came home with a birthday gift of a DVD which I already had, it was the one film I could think of which he might be able to find (most of my wishlist cannot be bought at Best Buy). This is the international version, which contains scenes that were cut from the American release, so I hadn't seen this version before. If you enjoy the film as presented in the theaters, then you will enjoy the DVD even more.</p><p>For me, Leon is just a likable character. He really has the kind of style which appeals to me. I guess there's a part of me which would also like to be a hitman, as well. \"The Professional\" is certainly an apt title, and it hits on why the character is appealing: he takes his life and his job seriously, thinking things through and conducting himself if a proper manner.</p><p>With the exception of one scene, there were no surprises as to why they cut the scenes from the American theater release. Across the board, these scenes depict either Matilda engaged in violent acts or the further exploration of the \"sexual\" relationship between Leon and Matilda.  Unfortunately, the scene which should have been in the theater release was too sandwiched between these other scenes to make the film continuous. The scene I speak of is when Leon explains what happened to him back in Italy to cause him to come to the U.S. and become a hitman. There are references to it earlier in the film, which are left dangling without this scene.</p><p>This movie is just filled with scenes that lift the spirit... or mine, at least. I love the ending, it is so well crafted. There are so many times you just have to sit back and admire Leon's handiwork. There are also ample doses of humor which keep the film very lively. If you have not seen this film, I wholeheartedly recommend it. And, of course, you should try to get your hands on the full version, you won't be disappointed.</p>
80035|pieceofshit|Airplane from Los Angeles to Paris|2001-05-26|<p>Hmm, where to begin. I was on a plane. I knew that I didn't want to sleep for another couple hours. And, I wasn't up for reading. That pretty much sums up why I watched this movie, because no other set of circumstances would have induced me to do so.</p><p>This film can pretty much be summed up by the moralism: \"Family life is the greatest life you can have.. Everything in the movie leads up to this point, and it is painfully obvious from the get go (hey, look at the title). The concept is interesting, because who hasn't wondered \"What if I went back and did things differently?\". The premise here has Nicolas Cage's character transported into the life today that he would be leading if he hadn't dumped his girlfriend to go to London on his stepladder to being the head of some major corporation. This involves a couple kids and a house in the burbs. The whole condition of this change, however, is that he is stuck in it until he realizes that this is the life he absolutely wants, deep down inside. Then, in the end, it all gets taken away and he has to figure out what to do. The wrap-around, which sends him in the end to the old girlfriend's apartment, is utterly pathetic and absolutely unrealistic.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I have nothing wrong with love and intimate relationships, and even people seeing their lives somehow fulfilled by having children. For me, I just get sick of the idea that this is the ONLY way to live a fulfilling life, which is really the message of the film. I also do not honestly believe that this IS a fulfilling life to live, because people are not defined by who they reproduce, but by what they do themselves. This film really raises to the level of highest merit the idea that you completely bend your life to such a set-up. Not that this guy's life was worth a damn to begin with, his type should be fed to starving animals. But, moralistic pictures like this are best avoided, for fear that they might pique one's frustrations at the problems of this society enough to force you into more drastic measures.</p><p>I suffered through this film so that you don't have to. I would never subject myself to this film again, and my already low respect for Cage just dropped lower (<strong>Face/Off</strong> is a plus). Next time I'm on a long flight, I'll have to keep this film in mind when I make my decision about whether to watch or not. There are some films which just should NOT be seen.</p>
80036|apocalypse|Cinema Rex, Paris|2001-05-28|<p>I already own the original film on both video and DVD. The only thing that disappoints me, therefore, about this film is that I'll probably want to get a copy of it on DVD when it is released. Of course, it hasn't even been released to the theaters in the states yet, so that will give me plenty of time to hock my copies to clear up shelf space.</p><p>Some people might criticize me for watching an American film while visiting France for the first time in my life, but I was suffering from some serious depression at not being able to communicate with anyone, so an English language film hit the spot. In particular, it gave me something to do for about 4 hours that didn't subject me to more suffering. In any case, I'm very glad I saw the film. It is a masterpiece to begin with, and I feel many of the added scenes make it that much better.</p><p>To begin with, <strong>Heart of Darkness</strong> is just an excellent book to base a movie on, and the reinterpretation through the eyes of Viet Nam to depict the horrors that were perpetrated there is a sign of true artistic talent. The true crime of Col. Kurtz is that he truly understands what has to be done to carry out the war the U.S. is fighting. There is no room for niceties, and the people running the army know that. But, there is a front which has to be put up, because war is always something which people fight against, and the blatant honesty of someone like Kurtz really threatens the illusion.</p><p>Along the way, you get to see the insanity which is fighting the war. You see actions of the Air Cav and the madness of the whole. You also see the madness of the individual, which is highlighted just a little bit more and a little bit better with the new scene where Chef hooks up with one of the bunnies.</p><p>The best addition to the film is by far the French plantation scene. Most of the scene is played out at the dinner table, but this scene really helps to inject the film with politics, which are always underlying but are brought out here. Essentially, you have many people sitting around a table discussing the entire situation of Viet Nam, from its history to why the U.S. is involved in the war. No one is putting forth a \"correct\" perspective, but the arena of discussion is opened and forced that much more on the viewer.</p><p>The film also appeals to the emotional in me. I route for the Vietnamese every time I see the scene where the young woman runs to the helicopter and throws in a grenade. The raw politics of the film make me feel good that there are some people (even if they don't understand the politics) that can capture a reality.</p><p>This is one of the greatest films ever made, and certainly one of the best ever made about the U.S. war against the Vietnamese people (<short=\"fullmetaljacket\" title=\"Full Metal Jacket\">Full Metal Jacket</a> is on my to-buy list). If you somehow have not seen this film yet, certainly take advantage of this film being in the theaters again to see it on the big screen, where it is that much more powerful.</p>
80037|legrandnord|La Geode, Museum of Science and Industry, Paris|2001-05-30|<p>This is actually the first real IMAX film I have ever seen, being on a huge concave screen (inside a large silver ball, even). I was with friends who were interested in seeing something, and we got there too late to really see anything in the museum before it closed. Luckily, the film had English headphones available, so I got to enjoy more than the sights and sounds.</p><p>This documentary is about the Inuit and the Saami, two groups of people who live off of the raindeer. The Inuit live in northern Canada, while the Saami live in Finland. Both peoples have adapted technology to their lifestyles, but retain some of their old ways. Along the way, you learn about the habits of raindeer and of the people who are able to survive in an Arctic climate because of them.</p><p>The photography is, of course beautiful, combined with the sounds of raindeer as a huge herd makes its way across the hills. There is also some footage from a black-and-white film used, since one of the Inuit they interview is the grandson of Nanook (<strong>Nanook of the North</strong> (1922), haven't seen).</p><p>What more is there to say. This film is enjoyable and educational, and quite likely will surprise you a bit if you have any pre-conceived notions of the subject matter. If you have an IMAX nearby and they show it in the U.S. (I assume they will, it won the Grand Prize at an IMAX film festival), it is worth catching.</p>
80038|misscongeniality|Airplane from Paris to Los Angeles|2001-06-10|<p>Not exactly a movie I would go see on my own account, but not utterly horrible either. You cannot expect much from a movie which has an FBI agent as the protagonist and is centered around a beauty pagent.</p><p>For the most part, Sandra Bullock's character is likeable. I loved the opening scene of the movie, where we see her character as a girl on the playground. It sets the tone for the picture quite well.</p><p>I really don't have much more to say. The ending is sappy, of course, with the obvious love interest fleshing out. I also wasn't sure how to take the little speech at the end about the kinds of people who would join such a pagent in the first place, but my respect for them (or the lack thereof) has not changed as a result. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, but it was funny enough to keep me awake on the plane when I was fighting sleep.</p>
80039|cthd|Airplane from Paris to Los Angeles|2001-06-10|<p>OK, so I've already seen this <short=\"cthd\" title=\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\">movie</a> 3 times since December. For me, this is actually an unusual situation, but being on the airplane yet again provides an exception to the rules.</p><p>I don't really have much to add except to comment on the dubbing. I'm not one for dubbing of foreign language films, particularly when I might actually feel like I'm getting something out of it. I can actually distinguish between some spoken languages, and this is due to this \"quirk\" of mine. Obviously the dubbing is distracting at first, but you come to ignore it after the movie has been rolling for a while. Li Mu Bai had a nice British accent, and others were generally unimpressive. I didn't hear any original voices, although some of these actors speak better English than they do Mandarin. The interesting thing is the translation of background noise, which you generally don't get in subtitled films but we did get here in the dubbed. That's all.</p>
80040|chocolat|Airplane from Paris to Los Angeles|2001-06-10|<p>Another film that I would not have watched had I not been on a plane and not intending to sleep. I had heard people say good things about the film, and know one person who swore it was the best movie they ever saw.</p><p>I should preface this review with the fact that I was just leaving France after being there for two weeks. In addition, I had learned a bit about France of the 1950s and 1960s which I hadn't know before, so the ideas were fresh in my head. Therefore, a film set in France, 1959, immediately made me think of the slaughter taking place in Algeria in order to prevent the Algerian people from being free from French domination. That this film  really takes place \"anywhere\" at \"anytime\" and has no relationship to the  world around it soured me a bit to the events of the film.</p><p>This is a feel-good romantic drama, plain and simple. And, with a little suspension of disbelief, I suppose that it isn't a bad one at that. I personally don't like all the spiritualistic mumbo-jumbo, so with that being a pivotal part of the film, we have another mark against it. I'm also not that big on chocolate, so I couldn't get into the whole idea of chocolate solving everyone's problems. To me, chocolate causes more problems than it's worth.</p><p>That's all I really want to say. The movie didn't make me wretch violently, but it also didn't pull me in and make me really sympathetic to any of the characters (despite some of them having the potential because of their backgrounds). I cannot recommend the film, but I've seen worse films.</p>
80041|blinddead2|DVD at home|2001-06-16|<p>This movie was package together with the first film, <strong>La Noche del Terror Ciego</strong>, in a DVD set which my roommate received for his birthday. When I came home, while doing laundry, he was watching the first film, which I only caught the tail end of. He was inspired to watch the second movie, and me not having anything to do decided to sit through it as well.</p><p>This movie was certainly much worse than the first. In addition, many of the features of the first movie were changed significantly. To boot, the movie was dubbed in English (the first was subtitled), which I tend to find distracting. </p><p>The concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the Knights Templar was involved in heinous and secret rituals. Upon discovery of these crimes, the local peasantry put the Templars to death in such a manner that their eyes can no longer be used, thus preventing them from returning from Hell to exact their revenge. We then jump to modern times where because of some event, the Templars arise from the dead to exact their revenge upon the villagers whose ancestors messed them up in the first place. Of course, since the undead knights have no eyes, they can only find their victims when they make some sort of noise.</p><p>The Templars were a secretive order, from about the 12th century, coming out of the Crusades. They were only around for about 150 years, before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the Pope and others. Because they were secretive, there were always rumors about their ceremonies, particularly for initiation. Also, because of the way the society was organized, you didn't necessarily have church officials overseeing things, which meant they didn't have an inside man when things heated up. And, because of the nature of their trials, they were tortured into confessions. The order was strongest in France, but did exist in Portugal and Spain, where the movies take place.</p><p>Where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knights drinking the blood directly from the body of the virgin (breast shots here, of course, this is a horror film after all), and then, once the knights come back to life, they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood; in this sequel, this all disappears. You still have the same scene (redone, not the same footage) of them sacrificing the virgin, but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from that. Thus, when they come back, they just hack people up with their swords or claw people to death, which I have to say is a much less effective means of disturbing your audience. There's also a time problem: in the first film the dating is much closer to the Templars, where here they are now saying it is the 500 anniversary of the peasants burning these guys at the stake, which would date it around 1473. And the way that the Templars lose their eyes is much less interesting as well. In the first, they have them pecked out by crows. Now they are simply burned out, and in quite a ridiculous manner.</p><p>Oh yeah, and maybe it was just me, but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie reappearing in this film (despite having died). Not really a problem, since the movie is completely different and not a sequel in the sense of a continuation, but odd none-the-less.</p><p>The highlight of this movie is the rich fellow who uses a child to distract the undead while he makes a break for the jeep. The child's father had already been suckered by this rich man into making an attempt to get the jeep, so he walks out and tells her to find her father. It comes somewhat out of the blue, and is easily the funniest scene in the film. Of course, why the child doesn't die at this point is beyond me, and disappointed for horror fans.</p><p>I couldn't possibly recommend this film to anyone. It isn't so bad that it becomes funny, so it just ends up being a mediocre horror film. The bulk of the film has several people holed up in a church, each making various attempts to go it alone in order to escape the blind dead who have them surrounded. When the film ends, you are not surprised at the outcome at all, in fact, quite disappointed. If you are into the novelty of seeing a Spanish horror film, see the first movie, which at least has some innovative ideas and not so expected outcomes.</p>
80042|escapeny|Video at home|2001-06-17|<p>This is one of those movies I never managed to hear about as a kid, and then never managed to see out of nostalgia as an adult. I guess I heard of the movie somewhere down the line, but it wasn't until the sequel came out a while back that I even let it onto my radar. Given the actors and director involved, I have to say it is a shame it took me this long.</p><p>The film isn't really all that amazing. The premise is cool and a nice social commentary on how the U.S. deals with crime... or doesn't, as the case may be. Beyond that, there are a lot of aspects to the film which are offensive. It is an enjoyable film to watch, but is essentially fluff that I  wouldn't recommend to anyone as \"must see.\"</p><p>The idea: America has become so overrun with crime that it turns the island of Manhattan into a prison from which no one ever returns. You gather from later in the film that the state doesn't do anything besides keep people from getting out, meaning no food, electricity or anything is provided.  Anyway, a \"left-wing\" radical hijacks Air Force One and crashes it into Manhattan. Now, enter Snake (Kurt Russell), who is about to be sent into the island for his own crimes, but can be pardoned on the condition that he brings the President out along with some important cargo he was carrying. Circumstances work to force Snake into the mission while giving him a deadline.</p><p>The beginning of the film is actually quite humorous, with the crazed radical at the helm of the plane. When I first heard what she was saying over the radio back at the prison base, I thought I had heard wrong. The sad thing is, there are actually some people who sound like that, and since this movie was released in 1981, I guess the various \"Red Armies\" would have been fresh in the minds of some people, with their antics.</p><p>What offended me about the film. Primarily, all the prisoners are either crazy or complete degenerates, which is a horrible misrepresentation of the prison population. The leader of the prisoners, Duke, is black, which couldn't be more stereotypical. And of course, everyone is dressed like some punk, to highlight that only degenerates who \"deserve\" to die in prison are here. On the positive side, there is a sense (in the background, never seen), that the prisoners have organized themselves enough to provide food, power and a few other things (though, then again, it is a smart white guy with glasses who is clearly the only person capable of providing this). </p><p>Like I said, not a horrible film. Pretty cheesy to be honest. Nothing I will ever see again, but I guess it is cultural capital that I can stick under my belt.</p>
80043|fightclub|DVD at home|2001-06-18|<p>When this movie first came out, it didn't appeal to me too strongly, and the opinions I got from my friends didn't strike me as that wonderful. When the movie first came out for rental, I again asked around and didn't get any great inspiration to see the film yet again. Luckily, when I headed to the video store this time, I asked my roommates what movie they'd like to see and, lo and behold, here we are.</p><p>I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and I enjoyed it very much. I'm not making any plans to buy it (I didn't even copy it), but I may be looking for the soundtrack at some point. In the end, the film falls through politically precisely because of its motivation, but there is a lot of good material in there. It also appeals to that part of me which I haven't really been able to express in years (partly for fear of landing in jail).</p><p>Edward Norton is hopelessly middle-class and is clearly not happy with it. There really isn't much to explore there, the world today really leaves no hope for anyone who cannot see outside of their own little shell, and our lead character is no exception. There is actually one scene that clearly refers to the other recent hit from this genre, <strong>American Beauty</strong>, but is more realistic here at least on the level of how the boss reacts. So he begins attending support groups for various diseases and such, none of which he has. First he meets Marla, then shortly thereafter meets Tyler. It is with Tyler that the fight club gets started.</p><p>There are a number of positive aspects to this film, some political and some personal. First off, just the idea of organizing in a cell structure was nice. And organizing for some goal, which in general is something you don't see in popular films, because they always like to push the bullshit idea that someone else will take care of your problems, whether politician or priest. I also liked the fact that when they do plant the bombs, they have cleared the buildings, so that no one will get hurt. A central theme is, of course, the alienation that people feel, even if it is middle-class alienation to begin with.</p><p>One of the interesting things about the fight clubs are that they are a  response to the lack of real, human, physical contact, which is a part of our alienation in this society. When they do come together to fight, it is in a very civil manner, not the brutal kill-or-be-killed attitude that really comes out in society when you think of fighting. It is a compact between friends that yes, we need to feel and share pain, but we are not here to destroy one another. Instead, the fight club builds people up. The movie openly states it at a couple points when people involve say that they have found a better support club.</p><p>The other thing that I liked about the film was the sense of synthesis at the end. There are two separate ideas competing throughout the film, and the end is not a destruction of one or both of those ideas, but a synthesis of a new person, who has rid himself of the baggage he had while pulling in the needed traits of the other. The movie, of course, ends at this point, but the future holds a humane character capable of action. (Sorry if this paragraph is a little vague, but I don't want to give away too much.)</p><p>The negative side to this film is really pulled from the original author, though I don't feel that the point comes out so strongly in the film. This is the whole idea of what it means to be a \"man.\" The complaint is that the distinction between men and women is disappearing, and that society is become more \"feminine\" as a result. I disagree with the direction of this, though I understand the argument underneath it. I think it is a good thing to move towards gender equality on the level of politics, economy and society. Especially in the area the author is likely complaining of, that is jobs, changes here will mean that jobs are safer. Of course, this isn't quite the case, and although capitalism blurs the gender lines out of economic necessity, it most certainly relies on creating a divide between men and women. This is not addressed in the film and is due to the limited perspective it has to offer.</p><p>If my lengthy review isn't enough to indicate that this is a good film, let me say it straight up... this is a good film. It really has the opportunity to make you think about different issues, however intentional or not. On top of that, the story and character development are very interesting, and action is thrown into boot. If you have somehow waited longer than me to see this film, stop waiting.</p>
80044|sixstring|DVD at home|2001-06-20|<p>I had never heard of this film until my current roommate started using a quote from it in his sig. It is one of those obscure, independent films, really on the level of a consciously B-movie. I used to be into that stuff when I was younger, watching Troma films for the fun of it, but haven't caught any of them recently.</p><p>The first thing that surprised me about the film was the level of fighting. There were techniques clearly pulled from Chinese martial arts, including taiji, and Chinese wire-fu, as well as some Japanese swordfighting. I did a little research, and it turns out that Jeffrey Falcon was in Hong Kong for at least 10 years in various films (often as the bad guy). Of course, the swordfighting was a little too staged, and it was often way too obvious that the blow did not land. There is, of course, no blood... whether this is because of budget or something else, I do not know.</p><p>The acting here is clearly quite bad. The main character delivers his lines in a whispery monotone the whole time, that reflect no emotion or even life at all. He isn't really alone in this either. It is clearly on purpose, but it just didn't come over well. I'm not sure that it could be pulled off by someone better.</p><p>As for the plot, that didn't impress me either. After a nuclear war in 1957, Lost Vegas is the only place left in the \"free\" world, and after 40 years, the king (Elvis) has died. Someone needs to take his place, and the top two contenders are our hero and Death. At the start of the film, Buddy (our hero) saves the life of a little boy, who then follows him through the rest of the film.</p><p>There are funny parts of the film, and part which are interesting, but I have to be honest there were also parts which literally put me to sleep. It just didn't involve me, and I wasn't watching this film late at night but in the middle of the day. I wouldn't recommend anyone seeing this film, the few good moments aren't worth it.</p>
80045|dancer|DVD at home|2001-06-23|<p>This got a lot of good reviews, and won two awards at Cannes, but I never could drag myself to see it at the theater. I guess that the concept behind the movie scared me a little, so I was reluctant to pay out the money. I usually am not reluctant to shell out $3 for a DVD rental, so here we are.</p><p>I'll go over the negative first, since a lot of it was at the start of the movie. The opening sequence was confusing as hell, and I still don't know what it was we were supposed to be looking at. That's not the best way  to start a movie. Then, the next thing that really stood out for me was the camera angles and filming. This film was certainly intended to be artistic, because there is no good reason to subject your audience to those kinds of shots. They were very jarring to the sense, and I didn't have a sense that the subject matter at that point was supposed to be, so it didn't fit together. I might be a little forgiving if it had seemed to add to the mood, but for me it just made me nauseous.</p><p>I had thought that the \"musical\" aspect of the film would be annoying, since I have never been a big fan of musicals (<strong>Oliver</strong> is the only exception I can think of off the top of my head). It actually went well, and the concept was interesting. In particular, because Bjork's character is going blind, it makes that much more sense that she would pick up on the rhythms around her. It also helped to make the story that much more tragic. I do considered Bjork to be a good singer, though I've never bought any of her albums.</p><p>The story is quite emotional, and I found myself moved to tears at least twice. A fellow viewer was upset at the film, not because of the tragedy, but because she couldn't understand why Bjork's character never spoke out. That is a quite asinine take on the movie, and shows a lack of understanding for anyone. It's pretty much on par with not understanding why someone would stay in an abusive relationship. The character is not supposed to have a strong grasp on things, but she has committed herself to one thing (long before the movie ever starts), and that is to see her son get surgery so that he does not suffer from the same genetic disease she has. The final scene of the movie is also quite powerful.</p><p>This isn't a great movie, it doesn't tackle political or social questions head on or anything noble like that. This really is an art film, but one which does have some redeeming value. This isn't a movie I would recommend to the weak at heart, but it is worth the time. It does bring up some social questions, even if only loosely.</p>
80046|leon|DVD at home|2001-06-23|<p>Well, I've already reviewed <short=\"leon\">this</a>. The perils of moving in with a new roommate is that you haven't seen all the same movies, and so you are doomed to watching each other's movie collections for a while. Not having anything special to do, I had no problem with watching this wonderful movie again.</p>
80047|wickedcityanime|DVD at home|2001-06-24|<p>My roommate owns this movie on DVD, and I had nothing to do with my Sunday afternoon. I thought my roommate had pretty good taste in movies... or at least one which I understand and can adapt around to make judgement calls, but this movie proved me wrong. I can understand why he has it, but it just ended up being like every other lousy anime that keeps me from truly enjoying the genre.</p><p>The premise of the movie is that there are a demon world and the human world which live in balance, in part due to a treaty which is up to be resigned in the next few days. The Black Guards (clearly unaware of the historical connotation here), are the human-demon police force that maintain peace. Our main character is a romantic playboy (they really have to come out and say this several times, so you understand it) and a female demon who is supposed to be the most attractive creature on the planted.</p><p>In any case, the movie amounts to a lot of sexual jokes, some very graphic gore, and a lot of squeezed tits as demons have their way with either each other or humans. This isn't an X-rated level porn, but it sure aspires to be. If you aren't into being titilated by animated rape, then you are probably not going to enjoy this film.</p><p>I certainly wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, even if I knew they were just a pervert. There could be an interesting story culled from these plot elements, but you won't find it here. It ends up with a love story twist at the end which is just downright embarassing to attribute to an adult author.</p>
80048|rushhour|Video at home|2001-06-25|<p>Here's another one I saw quite a long time ago, and a few times since. As with much of my recent viewing, I came home and my roommates were getting ready to watch the movie, so I descended into the depths with them. This is, by the way, my copy of the film.</p><p>I wouldn't call this Jackie's best film, but it isn't horrible. I know some people who just hate Chris Tucker, and I can see why, but he doesn't  really get on my nerves, so I enjoy the film. There is also a little bit of an effort here to throw in as many landmarks of L.A. as they could, so that gave me a smile.</p><p>Most of the stunts and fighting in this film aren't memorable. My favorite actually ends up being when they kidnap the little girl at the beginning, because she puts up a hell of a fight. Jackie has a few tricks to pull, but a lot of it is old (for those of us who've seen any of his Hong Kong flicks).</p><p>I'll be in the theater to see <short=\"rushhour2\">Rush Hour 2</a>, I'm sure, but I don't honestly expect that much of it. I'm not as thrilled with these buddy flicks, though, so I would personally like to see Jackie get over this hump in Hollywood. Luckily he is still producing movies outside the U.S., which is where he has more potential to shine, in my opinion.</p>
80049|ispit|Video at home|2001-06-29|<p>I had heard of this movie in high school. I remember it being in the horror section, but then it was an unrated version that you had to be over 18 to watch. My aunt and uncle also brought up the movie at some point, so it has been in the back of my mind for some time to watch it. As it turns out, my roommate as the unrated, collector's edition on video, so I used the fact that I came home from work early to await the arrival of deliverymen to watch it, finally.</p><p>No one is going to call this a spectacular film. I knew the basic idea behind it. A women is on vacation, she get brutally raped by four men, she gets revenge. Quite simple. I didn't know what to expect as far as unrated went, but I cannot figure out why this wasn't simply rated R. You see her breasts and her pubic hair, but never anything from the men, and the rape is all simulated. As far as the acting, this movie isn't so horrible. The only truly bad acting comes from the main rapist's wife, who just cannot deliver lines naturally (remeniscent of early John Water's films).</p><p>The movie is very slow in its development, and the rape scenes are drawn out a bit. They aren't so badly done, actually. I had a bit of fear that I'd be titilated by these scenes, but that wasn't the case at all. They do help build up the tension and sense of disgust. The real value of the film is when she gets revenge, but then only one of them is truly sweet. The final two were actually a let down, coming all too quickly and easily.</p><p>I guess my only other comment is to not bother seeing the film if you've already seen the trailer. Luckily, it was tacked on the end of the tape, because after watching it, it was clear that all the moments that the film builds up to (thus, the stuff worth waiting for) are given away in the trailer.</p><p>I cannot recommend this film. Sure, I'm glad I've finally gotten it out of the way, but unless you have some penchant for late 70s film stock, there isn't much of worth in this film except for the castration scene (you don't see it, of course). The rest of the film is annoying, and the characters will likely get on your nerves.</p>
80050|sayanything|Video at home|2001-07-01|<p>I'll be honest, I don't remember every hearing about this movie in my life. To push my point a little farther, I had the impression that John Cusack didn't make any movies after <strong>Better Off Dead</strong> and <strong>One Crazy Summer</strong> until <strong>Grosse Pointe Blank</strong>. I guess he was just making a lot of movies that never entered my radar. In any case, my roommate is a big fan, and has quite a number of his movies. We were talking about <strong>Grosse Pointe Blank</strong>, which I like a lot, and she mentioned this as her other favorite. With nothing to do on a Sunday afternoon, I figured \"why not?\"</p><p>The film isn't as fantastic as my roommate made it out to be, but then I didn't really expect it to be. This isn't my kind of film, and that's not simply because it's a high school film that I've just grown out of. The one truly redeeming quality of the film is that is doesn't attempt a make-over, and perhaps that is why it was more powerful (as per many critics). Obviously the two people change a little as a result of their relationship, but neither tries to turn the other into something they are not, like a stunning beauty or most popular kid in school.</p><p>There isn't much else for me to say. It isn't a bad film, and I'm sure most people would enjoy it (provided they aren't totally anti-social), but I also wouldn't recommend this film to anyone (in contrast, the more recent <short=\"highfidelity\" title=\"High Fidelity\">High Fidelity</a> moved me quite a bit).</p>
80051|fifth|DVD at home|2001-07-09|<p>I have heard a number of things about this movie over the years, but never knew what to make of any of it. Being a Luc Besson movie, I was certainly intrigued, but then I'd heard a lot of bad things about it. It has something of a cult status as well, which can often be a good sign. Anyway, my roommate rented it so I watched it.</p><p>Visually, this is an interesting movie to watch. A lot of effort went into making this thing look pretty tight and fascinating. Chris Tucker was one of the more interesting additions as well, in a role I didn't expect. On the sci-fi level, there aren't a lot of things which differ so much from the present, but some of the projections of the cities and labor are good. </p><p>On the down side, I didn't find the plot that creative or intriguing. For science fiction, I'm of the opinion that something has to be said about society to make the film genuinely shine (putting aside pure action, but I cannot think of any examples that cross that boundary right now). There's a simple message of the need for love to validate life, but it isn't worth the effort. The Egyptian stuff intrigued me, but again, it was too little.</p><p>I cannot really recommend this film. I wouldn't say to avoid it like the plague, I just didn't feel it satisfied me. There's a part of me left wondering about different things (was that a real language or made up? are there many references I'm missing?), but I wasn't curious enough to track them down after finding about 10 dead websites once devoted to the movie. Maybe that in and of itself is some indication of the movie among even its fans.</p>
80052|bighit|DVD at home|2001-07-09|<p>I've seen this movie a couple times already, some time ago, and enjoyed it thoroughly. I had been away and when I returned on Sunday, my roommates had rented this. Coming home early to wait for delivery people to show up, I started going through the extra on the DVD, but I have to be honest and say they aren't worth a spit. The commentaries are very boring and don't really give you any insight into the film. The cut scenes were cut for good reason. (If you want good commentaries, see <short=\"evildead\" title=\"Evil Dead\">Evil Dead</a> or <short=\"conan\" title=\"Conan the Barbarian\">Conan the Barbarian</a> which both show what fun commentaries can be.. So, in the end I just restarted the film and watched it through.</p><p>This movie isn't one you watch for substance, you watch it because it is fun, pure and simple. It's another one of those hitman movies, which always have some appeal for me, but the characters, situations, and action just push it to the top. The acting is pretty good, and I like the music. I still cannot decipher what the one reggae/rap song in there is that I really like (\"Brotha killa man\"?). And to top it off, I just find China hot.</p><p>The influence of Hong Kong on this film is so obvious (as if the director and producers didn't give it away). I really don't know how to analyze a film that well, but there is something that really marks a difference from American films. Of course, more and more American films are starting to pull from the Hong Kong style, which I think is making for better action movies (though I have to say that with some reservations). In any case, the action is completely over the top, creating it's own humor on top of the jokes.</p><p>Basically, if you haven't seen this film and can enjoy a good action flick, get off your duff (temporarily at least) and see this one.</p>
80053|kotd|United Artists Theater in Marina Del Rey|2001-07-11|<p>I'm almost ashamed at how long it took me before I saw this film, having been unable to see it opening weekend. As it stands, I only barely got to see it this time, showing up just as the previews ended. I am very happy I had the time to see it, and I already plan to purchase it on DVD when it is released.</p><p>Well, if that didn't give away my opinion, I really liked this film. I've seen a number of complaints about plot and acting, but it wasn't a problem for me. There were some lines which weren't the greatest, conveying the idea but not quite packing the punch that could have been there. Overall, though, I liked the story line, and don't know what else one could expect from an action movie.</p><p>You see this movie for action, and it has plenty. I enjoyed the fight scenes, which were fast and furious. The fighting is much more realistic than many of Jet's movies, and I didn't notice any wire work at all. There is a healthy use of props, and you don't have long drawn-out fights that just don't happen unless your opponent really knows how to fight (and the one long fight in the movie is precisely between Jet and two guys who know how to fight.</p><p>If you have been lazier than me, or busier, free up the time and check this movie out. It is a classic, and I'm happy to see it because it means that Jet is making it into the mainstream and will be making movies for the time being. His English is also pretty good, which is the other stumbling block which these Hong Kong actors have been facing. I'm looking forward to <short=\"theone\" title=\"The One\">The One</a> this fall.</p>
80054|btilc|DVD at home|2001-07-19|<p>I watched this movie a number of times when I was younger. I cannot remember if it was on regular TV or on one of the movie channels regularly, but in any case, there were plenty of opportunities to catch it. I hadn't watched it since then, however, and although I remembered it as a fun film I couldn't remember much of the plot or details. So, what better excuse for buying the collector's edition DVD.</p><p>I haven't made it through the extra on the DVD yet, but the film is as fun as I remembered it. There are just some great premises and effects that are used, surprising me a bit based on the year this movie was made. I never layed Mortal Combat, but I can clearly see where at least one of the characters got their inspiration.</p><p>The fights are enjoyable, and the interaction between the different characters is well done. I'll have to report back on the extras once I've seen them, but at this point I'm not disappointed with my purchase.</p>
80055|bully|Nuart Theatre|2001-07-20|<p>The premise of this film intrigued me, and when I explained it to a friend he also thought it would be a good view. Besides, I remember liking  <strong>Kids</strong> when I saw it in the theater many years ago, and was willing to see what the director had to offer.</p><p>The movie is based on actual events in southeastern Florida in the early 1990s. One guy, the lead character, has been \"friends\" with the bully since he was a kid, but just keeps taking the punishment. The reason is never clearly revealed, though sexual tensions are certainly there to boot. Other people get involved, including the rape of two different women, and the conclusion arises that they should kill this guy. Everyone comes around to the idea, including people who initially have no motivation whatsoever, and they carry out the deed.</p><p>The movie is well put together, and you get a solid glimpse at the kinds of lives these late teens were living. But in the end, the movie really doesn't have much to offer. You get a lot of shots of naked bodies and R-rated sex and rape scenes. But the substance isn't anything to shout about. The economic differences between people, in particular how each male lead's parents react to the circumstances, is quite good, but isn't enough to hold the film up as a worthwhile endeavor.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. It is apparently based on the  memoirs of the lead character, who is on death row (don't know if he's been executed yet), but it also seems like a book not worth reading. This might appeal to some young people with morbid leanings, but in the end it doesn't really teach us about anything except how immature minds can tear each other apart.</p>
80056|lumumba|Music Hall Theatre in Beverley Hills|2001-07-21|<p>Political films are so far and in-between in this country that the minute you hear of a new one coming out, the tension immediately begins to build. I knew this film existed a year ago, but didn't get a chance to see it when it played at an Afro-American Film Festival then. Finally, it has been released to art houses, and I'm happy that at least some of us get to watch it.</p><p>The film is well done. You get a glimpse into the life of Lumumba and the Congo (renames Zaire shortly thereafter, and back to Congo today) in 1960. You primarily get to see the political maneuvering of the people at the top. You see the role that Belgians play in guaranteeing that their colony is not lost to them. You see the role that the U.S. plays in undermining independent policy anywhere in the world. And you get to see the risks of limited political goals by third-world leaders.</p><p>Although the outcome of this film is not a positive one (the CIA and Mobutu and quite a few other local interests torture and execute Lumumba), the film is actually uplifting. Lumumba was a fighter, and through it all he does not waver from his goals. This isn't the story of someone beaten down and defeated in agony. It is the story of someone who fought a good battle that he was simply not able to win with the forces at hand. I was not the least bit depressed by this film.</p><p>My word of warning to this film is that you are better off knowing the history of the Congo before you watch it. I have read a bit myself, and was familiar with the events leading up to the film, and somewhat following it. You do not see the events which force Belgium to give up its colony, and thus you cannot fully understand why these events are taking place. I am sure that someone without this background is going to be confused at times, and certainly any film on a historical figure requires context... and this movie does not provide it.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film to anyone interested in any of the subjects covered, from colonialism, CIA overthrow of governments, 20th century African history, etc. It may be hard for those without prior knowledge of the subject matter, but it is certainly one of the best political films to come out in the last couple years.</p>
80057|conandestroyer|Video at home|2001-07-22|<p><short=\"conan\" title=\"Conan the Barbarian\">Conan the Barbarian</a> is one of the greatest films out there, and certainly the best fantasy / adventure film (<strong>Legend</strong> is the only other film I can think of which even competes). This sequel is, unfortunately, a sequel and encompasses what that usually means.</p><p>The plot of this movie runs like a novice Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure. You have the adventuring party assembled, given a task, and spirited through a linear course of events until the conclusion rolls along. I could have written this plot in junior high school, when I was still obsessed with hack-and-slash adventuring. The scripting here doesn't help. I'm never sure why the thief comes out with his lines, but I'd not be surprised to find that the actor was related to the director in some way.</p><p>There are some redeaming qualities to the film. It is quite funny, sometime on purpose, sometimes unintentionally. Grace Jones is, of course, a wonderful character. And some of the scenes are put together in an appealing way.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I actually own this video, but I don't think it is for everyone. I like it and watch it because I'm a fan of the genre, as weak as it is. Seeing Arnold act drunk has a quality all of its own. But if you are not in the same boat as me, don't bother with this film. Watch the first and revel in its magnificence, and then leave well enough alone.</p>
80058|yojimbo|DVD at home|2001-07-27|<p>I'm sure there are many people who consider this one of, if not THE, greatest samurai films ever made. It certainly deserves to be up near the top somewhere. <a href=\"http://www.criterionco.com/\" title=\"Criterion Collection\">Criterion</a> makes a DVD of this film, and in a purchasing binge I decided to buy.</p><p>As for the quality of the DVD, it probably could not be topped. There are some flaws in the film transfer, but they are certainly due to the fact that this 40-year old film doesn't have flawless copies lying around. The picture was crisp and the subtitles excellent. If you already know this movie, I certainly recommend the purchase of the DVD.</p><p>The story here is classic. A samurai walks into a village that is clearly not at peace. He quickly learns that there are two rival factions fighting for control of the town, and that the local authorities are not going to be the ones to change this. The samurai then takes it upon himself to solve this dilemma by pitting the two sides against each other.</p><p>The plot and acting are wonderful, and this is certainly one of Mifune Toshiro's signature films. As the story unfolds you find yourself pulled in more and more, delighted by the outcomes that are certainly just. The film also plays on the realities of gang rivalries and the nature of the small-time crooks who lead and make up the foot soldiers of them. You also get a window into a historical time period, sometime in the 1860's, where society is falling apart for quite a few.</p><p>If you are at all interested in Japanese cinema, or even the roots of quality Western plots, you need to see this film. This is not a sloppy  chan-bara film to highlight and disply random bloodshed, but a quality work of cinema that adds incredible value to its genre.</p>
80059|planet|United Artists Theater in Marina Del Rey|2001-07-28|<p>I generally like Tim Burton films. <strong>Edward Scissorhands</strong> is a classic which I have a copy of, and I have been pleased with the majority of his outings. Needless to say, <short=\"planetoftheapes\" title=\"Planet of the Apes\">Planet of the Apes</a> is one of the finest sci-fi films ever released... not necessarily for the technical aspects, but the story and Charleton Heston are just sweet. This was enough to encourage me to see the film.</p><p>If you are looking for a consistent film, this is not it. There are a lot of holes, and the characters don't always make sense. Don't even go into motivation. This is really a simplistic film that you watch for enjoyment and not because you expect to get something out of it.</p><p>I did enjoy the film. I will never see it again, because it is just not that great, but there were some quality points to it. The work on the apes was superb. The mannerisms of chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans are pulled in and used to construct these societies. It's not perfect, of course, but I appreciate the effort that did go into this aspect of the film. The other highlight of the film, for me, was the love triangle and the tension that came out between the two females. Not to mention that Estella Warren is just fine all over.</p><p>Good science fiction tells you about your own society. I believe this to be true, but in this case, all we are told is that society is hitting new lows. There are some bits about racism and environmentalism in the film, but these are nowhere near as strong as in the original. If you are looking for mindless fun, see the film. Don't expect much out of it, and you won't be disappointed. If you are worried about it disgracing the original, then avoid it, because it does just that.</p>
80060|bluecollar|DVD at home|2001-07-29|<p>This is one of the greatest movies that has ever been made about the American working class. I have seen it a couple times before, quite some time ago. I was ordering a batch of DVDs recently and saw that this was on DVD, including a commentary track. I haven't listened to the commentary yet, but that's just icing on an already delicious cake anyway.</p><p>My memory isn't the best, especially for certain things like movies and  books. I cannot remember movies very well, particularly lines, unless I've seen a movie several times. So, I was remembering this film as a comedy. It is actually a drama, with some very funny parts in the first half of the film. After a certain point, though, don't expect humor... expect only hard reality.</p><p>Basically, you get a very good sense of what it was like to work in the auto factories in the late Seventies. This is after the black movement in this country had been crushed, but needlesstosay, it is still fresh in people's heads. Besides, it is glaringly there... Richard Pryor's character has 10 years of seniority as of 1977, i.e. he is one of the many blacks who were hired after Detroit blew up in '67. You get a sense of the change this has made for people, but it still isn't easy. The autoworkers aren't idealized, as they so often are, as the absolute elite of the working class. People are struggling to make ends meet.</p><p>You also get to see what the problems are for people. It is sometimes the little things that frustrate you the most, because they emphasize the dehumanization that work puts on us all, the way it strips us of our dignity. The broken locker or the vending machine that keeps stealing your money are excellent examples. The foreman is, of course, the best. He's constantly on everyone's case, often without any clear reason. Every comment out of his mouth is to try to squeeze a little more productivity out of you while demeaning you more.</p><p>The race issues that this movie confronts are excellent as well. You see that black and white do work together, but are still separated quite a bit. You see the difference of viewpoint towards the union depending upon race. It was beautiful the way that the local president touts how their union was the first to do this or that, which for anyone who knows union history knows this is bullshit. It IS the line the union officials feed, but it was precisely that very posturing while blacks still weren't getting the better jobs that helped lead to the explosions we saw in the Sixties.</p><p>I cannot recommend this movie enough. It is certainly one of the more obscure films out there, ignored for a number of reasons (the unions absolutely hate it). But it needs to be discovered. I'm so happy to see that it is on DVD, and plan to invite others to watch it whenever I can.</p>
80061|rushhour2|United Artists Theater in Westwood|2001-08-03|<p>There's nothing like a slough of bad reviews to bring down your expectations of a movie. I had planned to see this film no matter what because, after all, it is Jackie Chan. I wasn't expecting much anyway, given that I don't find Chris Tucker to be the best of comedians, to say the least.</p><p>I enjoyed the film quite a bit. I found it funny, and the action was enough to keep me engaged, though I wouldn't say that any of the stunts or fights are particularly memorable. I honestly think that this film was  better than the first. It is still not going to make it up there as one of Jackie's best movies, but I'd watch it again if the opportunity arose.</p><p>My one complaint would probably have to be Tucker. His comedic style is just not appealing to me. Sometimes he makes me chuckle, but sometimes he also makes me wince, particularly with that bad, outdated racist jokes. I haven't seen <short=\"friday\" title=\"Friday\">Friday</a> yet, but so far <short=\"fifth\">The Fifth Element</a> is the best Tucker has been... and not because he's  particularly funny or a good actor, but because the role fit him so much better. I'm not sure he should bother playing straight characters, he fits the flaming gay persona too well.</p><p>This is a good movie, and worth the scratch to get into the theater. The plot is good enough for an action movie, and there are a few enjoyable sights.</p>
80062|sanjuro|DVD at home|2001-08-05|<p>After the success of <short=\"yojimbo\">Yojimbo</a>, Kurosawa was forced by the studios to make a sequel. To many, the sequel was even better. I wouldn't make such a claim, not because I think one is better than the other, but because they are both masterpieces.</p><p>It had been a long time since I'd seen this film. The only thing I really remember was the admonition by the old woman to not kill anyone, to not use violence, and of course the wonderful ending, where after a blood-less movie you get enough blood (actually pressurized chocolate syrup, it is black and white after all) to more than make up for the lack. I remembered it as a good movie, funny and well crafted, but I needed to see it again.</p><p>Our hero happens across a group of young samurai who have uncovered corruption within their clan and are determined to put an end to it. In their youthful ignorance, however, they are not prepared for the enemy. Sanjuro is able to lead them through, all the while pointing out what a true samurai should be, but not even getting it right, only better. It is the older woman who is able to point out the failings of Sanjuro, and he being the intelligent man he is does what he can to incorporate the advice.</p><p>The twists and turns of the story line are wonderful. You don't laugh because of a punchline, you laugh because of the way in which things fold upon themselves and the obvious absurdity of circumstances. The captive guard is beautiful, as is the older woman who brings everything into contrast. This is truly a moving experience.</p><p>If you haven't seen this film, I would have to ask, \"why not?. Kurosawa was a master of cinema, and here is another shining example. I certainly am glad that this DVD is a part of my collection, and plan to add more of his works as they become available (where is that remastered <strong>Ran</strong> DVD?).</p>
80063|unbreakable|DVD at home|2001-08-06|<p>I hadn't really noticed this film when it was in the theaters. I saw <strong>Sixth Sense</strong> in the theaters, Shyamalan's first film, which was a good movie to watch once, but I just never managed to hear enough about this film to want to see it. Afterwards, however, I began to hear more, particularly the comic book aspect of the film. So, when my sick roommate wanted to watch a film, I volunteered to go pick this one up from the rental store.</p><p>I liked this film a lot. It was an interesting story, and the whole comic book tie-in was well crafted. As had been explained to me, I could see how nearly every scene was actually framed like a comic book. And, of course, the conception that comic books are merely a exageration of our realities, of our histories, was a interesting concept to build upon. The ending is also built up to well, and not the least bit disappointing, particularly the way in which it runs like a \"true story.\"</p><p>I'm not going to say this is the greatest film, but the acting is solid and everything else is fresh enough (the formula behind the way the story is revealed is sure to get old in Hollywood very soon) that anyone who likes movies is going to enjoy. It is a drama, there is very little action unlike what one might expect out of a film inspired by comic books, but it is good drama, not the utterly sappy crap that is so often thrown our way. Catch the movie when you can.</p>
80064|muppetsinspace|Video at home|2001-08-10|<p>Ah, the Muppets. If there is one thing I could pull from my childhood, one television series that I would absolutely buy if they put the whole, complete thing on DVD, it would be <strong>The Muppet Show</strong>. This does not mean, of course, that all the recent movies are nearly up to the par set by Jim Henson when he was alive, but they've got a strong ground to build upon.</p><p>The weirdest thing is, of course, seeing new characters. The bug and the Jamaican thing are certainly new, but the bug was certainly a nice addition to the cast (note: I never saw the recent TV series, where I think these characters were added). The heart of this story, however, is good old Gonzo. As we have all wondered, what is Gonzo? This is the question that moves this story, when Gonzo is contacted from outer space by others from his home planet (we never get a name here that I caught). There are the necessary government agent who come in to thwart Gonzo's hopes to reunite with his own kind.</p><p>This is a fun movie. The antics and jokes are fairly non-stop, and the story, although absurd at times, is a gem. The main question left lingering for me is: did they have to pay and costume all those extras. Or, did they just show up on call?</p><p>What more can I say about a Muppet film? If you like the Muppets, you are probably going to like this film and have already seen it anyway. If you are not a Muppet fan, then you should watch <short=\"muppetmovie\" title=\"The Muppet Movie\">The Muppet Movie</a> first or catch the TV show (is it syndicated anywhere?) to get the flavor. The early movies are all released on DVD now, so it shouldn't be hard to get hold of them.</p>
80065|dnd|DVD at home|2001-08-13|<p>I knew that someday I would have to watch this movie. It is an issue of honor, being the long time fan of the table-top RPG. I couldn't bring myself to watching it in the theater, the reviews were just too bad and the preview was enough to show me that the story was going to be lame. I have not been proven wrong, but at least my conscience can rest now.</p><p>There are so many bad points of this movie to dwell on. The acting is atrocious. Most of the people aren't qualified to be in front of a camera, and then you have the two main bad guys over-acting. The cadence of the number two man's speech is amazing at times.</p><p>The story is horrible and full of holes, particularly for fans of the game. Being able to walk into the thieves' guild straight off the street was just a bad judgement call by the director. The worst, of course, has to be the empress and her \"all people should be equal\" line. The joy I get from playing as well as from watching movies (typically) is some relationship to reality. Crap like this doesn't even come close.</p><p>When you get into game elements, there are many things that are disturbing. The beholders are a shame. The dragons don't really amount to anything. The portrayal of the dwarf is horrible, as an utter slob who tries to fit into some of the worn-out stereotypes. He was played like a 12-year-old novice of the game would play a dwarf fighter. I didn't mind the addition of monsters which are nowhere to be seen in any of the manuals, although I do have to question the reasoning behind it with so much to choose from already.</p><p>There are fun parts to this movie. Actually, it is almost so bad in areas that it becomes enjoyable on a B-movie level. There are lines which make you laugh, and a few scenes are actually thought out. I had to laugh when the lead female says that she's the daughter of a \"ninth-level mage.\"</p><p>There is no good reason to see this film. A friend of mine said that the true crime of him having seen it in the theater is that he cannot ever get that two hours of his life back. I'm not that harsh, but you'd have to have a really good excuse to sit through this... and I cannot think of one now.</p>
80066|ghostbusters|DVD at home|2001-08-13|<p>I hadn't see this movie since I was 10. I remembered bits and pieces about it, but the main thing I remember is that I had just got glasses and then turned around and forgot to bring them to the theater, so I couldn't make things out all that well. That probably helped the special effects. The movie is certainly a cultural landmark, so no harm in refreshing the memory.</p><p>There are a few problems with the film, plot holes and leaps which could have been taken care of better, but for the most part this is good viewing. The different humor bounced around between the different characters is excellent. The music goes well with the movie, and not just the Ray Parker Jr. song, but also the swing music and ambience. The plot is genuinely interesting and acting on par with some of the classic greats (at least for my generation) of comedy.</p><p>Unless you're under twenty, you've probably seen this film already. If for any reason you haven't, then add it to your viewing list... it was truely a movie that helped shape my childhood, even if for only a short while.</p>
80067|shichinin|DVD at home|2001-08-13|<p>Wow, what do you say about one of the greatest samurai films ever made. I'm not sure if I'm up to the task, but I'll certainly try. I saw this film for the first time in high school, about the time that I discovered the foreign  movie section in the video store. I've seen in maybe once or twice since then. Now it is part of my collection, and I'm sure that I'll see it many more times to come.</p><p>There are so many wonderful aspects to this film. Perhaps my favorite is the role that Mifune Toshiro plays. It is through him that we really flesh out the relationship between the peasants and the samurai class. There is comic relief in his character, but it comes precisely from the fact that he is a peasant aspiring to be a samurai. His understanding and viewpoint of every issue is different because of it. He is able to point out the failings of both groups because he straddles the lines between them, and in turn have more compassion than anyone else because he is connected to the people of the village.</p><p>This film really gives you a good picture of the time period, precisely because you see the nexus of the different classes. The samurai, wandering about because there is war and disorder. The banditry, which arises from the warfare and chaos of society. And of course, the peasants, who get trapped at the bottom, fed upon by all the other classes and must use all their resources to come through. The portrayal here is not simply to flesh out a nice story, but really brings the society and conditions of the time to life, so that someone without much knowledge can go away with some history.</p><p>The story in turn teaches its lessons and values. These run the gamut from love to friendship to respect to the cycles of life. There is so much to draw from (it is over 3 hours, after all), that the film provides insights with repeated viewings.</p><p>I would recommend this film to anyone. Those with ADD might not be able to last through to the end, but everyone else should pull something from the movie that they didn't have before. This is what filmmaking is about, and yet another reason why Kurosawa was such a master of the artform.</p>
80068|ironmonkey|DVD at home|2001-08-17|<p>I've already reviewed <short=\"ironmonkey\" title=\"Iron Monkey\">this</a> movie. I watched it because a friend of mine is doing research on wire-fu for a script he is putting together. Given that this is certainly a movie most wire-fu fans have seen, and that it is already on my shelf, we started here. Nothing more to add except that the lead female is still one of the hottest women I have seen in a movie.</p>
80069|angelasashes|DVD at home|2001-08-19|<p>This is one of those movies that really didn't hit my radar. There was a part of me which thought it might be interesting to read the book (I haven't), because I had come across a reference to it in someone else's writing, but I didn't even know what the film was about.</p><p>The movie runs from about 1935 to 1946, primarily in Limerick, Ireland. It is essentially the story of growing up in a dirt-poor family at a time when  most people didn't have anything, anyway. It follows the author, as his siblings die, his father drinks and never works, and he somehow gets an education.</p><p>Although the film has a lot of scenes of the hard life this family goes through, it is quite in the abstract. What I mean is that we see this family and this family alone, and not the general state of things. The film is shot in their home and alleyway, a bit a school, and that is just about it. You learn something about growing up Roman Catholic and Irish, but for me it was still the tale of an individual boy. In the end, of course, we are to celebrate that this one boy has found a way to get to America, overcoming the hardship to make a \"better\" life for himself.</p><p>Not having read the book, I wouldn't not call this a great film. It is a pleasure to watch, and there are funny scenes and not really any tear-jerking scenes, so it doesn't bring you down. But that is it, which for me isn't enough. Given the subject matter, I would have liked to have seen a  broader picture of things. This family seems to be on the bottom of things, but you don't have a fuller sense of the society of the time. For me, the value of historical films is often that you learn something human about another place and time. This movie could quite easily be picked up and place 60 years later without changing much.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, though I'll not swear against it. It wasn't a complete waste of time, but I don't feel I've grown as a person from watching it, either.</p>
80070|temptation|Video at home|2001-08-19|<p>I had heard of this movie before, but didn't know much about it. Given that it was located in the \"Foreign\" section of the most hated of video stores, I didn't expect non-stop Hong Kong action. The movie is definitely drama, with just a touch of fighting.</p><p>It's hard to form an opinion about this film. It is somewhat confusing, even for me (i.e. someone who knows more than averages about Chinese history and culture). The basic plot is that a general stands by while his lord is murdered by his brother, the soon-to-be emperor of the early Tang dynasty. His mother then forces him to swear that he will not sully the family's name by taking position under the new ruler, but will try to overthrow him. He seeks refuge in a Buddhist monastery, along with some of his former soldiers, trying to lay plans. As time passes, and temptations come, he begins to turn to the life of a monk.</p><p>The movie is well made, and quite beautiful to watch. The plot, however, is very slow-moving. For me, the real highlight of the film is the last third, when our protagonist enters a second temple, where the abbot is an old man. This guy is quite funny, and of course, the most adept at conveying the lessons of Buddhism, which is really what this movie seems to be about.</p><p>This isn't the greatest of films, and I'm not sure that I would ever recommend it to anyone. I'm not sorry for having seen it, but it is still hard to explain, and I'm not sure what most people would be able to get out of it. Perhaps if you are Buddhist, you might enjoy it.</p>
80071|bedhead|DVD at home|2001-08-20|<p>This short film is Robert Rodriguez's first film, clearly made with the aid of his family. The short appears on the <short=\"mariachi\">El Mariachi</a> side of the double-side DVD (together with <short=\"desperado\">Desparado</a>. It is a nice little treat of black-and-white film.</p><p>A little girl hits her head after a tangle with her older brother, giving her telekinetic powers. After meting out some revenge on the brother, and a vain attempt to remove his horrible hair (bedhead), she suffers another knock to the head that sends her to the hospital. That's it.</p><p>It is easy to see from this short film how Robert was able to win a slightly larger (though not much so) budget to film <short=\"mariachi\">El Mariachi</a>. It is very creative, funny, and the style of editing and filming are wonderful. He even does a wonderful job with his actors, all untrained as far as I know or can tell.</p><p>If you catch this double-DVD, either through purchase or rental, make sure you take the time to watch this lovely featurette. I'd recommend seeing it before the other films, but there's value in it no matter when you see it.</p>
80072|mariachi|DVD at home|2001-08-21|<p>I'd seen this movie some time ago, on video, after hearing about it. The John Woo style action genre has never been my forte, but it is certainly something I enjoy when the opportunity comes along. This movie is clearly in that vein, and although it shows the signs of a first film, it is quite well done.</p><p>A mariachi makes his way into a small Mexican town, looking for work. He doesn't have much luck in this town, but is able to meet one woman who inspires him. Unfortunately, he is quickly mistaken for a mobster who also walks around in black clothing and carries a guitar case (only his is filled with weapons). The rival gangster sends his men to snuff out the threat, and our hero is thrust into a most unpleasant situation.</p><p>There are many funny parts to this movie, some touching, and the action is fairly well done. There are some scenes which don't quite come off as well as a more experience director would have done them, such as the pair of gunmen who shoot each other across the truck, but overall the gunfighting comes across well. The pacing is slow, and unevenly so at times. Like many great stories, this one doesn't exactly have a happy ending, but it certainly leaves the door open for sequels (and thus my plan to watch <short=\"desperado\">Desperado</a> asap).</p><p>If you are into gun ballads, then you need to see this film. I think a lot of people can enjoy it, but I could see how it would be disappointing to some. This movie must have been some inspiration for <short=\"sixstring\">Six String Samurai</a>, and certainly a few other movies from the 1990s. I'm more anxious to see <short=\"spykids\" title=\"Spy Kids\">Spy Kids</a> now that I know who the director is.</p>
80073|desperado|DVD at home|2001-08-22|<p>What would happen if <short=\"mariachi\">El Mariachi</a> was made with a  budget greater than $7000. It is called <strong>Desperado</strong>. This isn't a remake, of course, but the sequel. Word is that Robert Rodriguez is also working on a third film to follow... I'll be there for that one.</p><p>Antonio Banderas has replaced Carlos Gallardo as the Mariachi in this film, and the language is English now, but a lot of the same spirit is here. And, Carlos actual makes a brief (and appropriate) appearance near the end of the film. Our hero has taken to a life of gunning down drug dealers, ultimately in search of the kingpin behind Moco, the man who killed his true love in the first film. Of course, this movie sets up for the third installment right here, because we learn that Bocho (the arch-nemesis of this film) is not the top of the ladder. What does this mean. Even bigger guns and shoot-outs in the next film, which is slated to bring down the entire Mexican government.</p><p>Rodriguez does not hide his appreciation for John Woo, and openly says that <short=\"thekiller\" title=\"The Killer\">The Killer</a> and <short=\"hardboiled\" title=\"Hard-Boiled\">Hard-Boiled</a> were the greatest action films of the time to which he had to measure himself. The body count here is not quite as high, but it is certainly well-done and inspired. Banderas does a good job in this role, and his handling of the action is superb.</p><p>I cannot really think of any complaints about this film. Hell, once you've seen Salma Hayek naked, your will to complain evaporates into thin air. You aren't looking for strong social commentary here, just pure gun-toting action. And hey, there is a message in here, about drugs, power and the limitations of isolated people to stand up to it.</p><p>If it isn't obvious yet, I highly recommend this film. The characters are likeable (Cheech Marin plays a bartender, by the way) and the story will keep you smiling.</p>
80074|flowersofshanghai|DVD at home|2001-08-23|<p>This movie has gotten some great reviews, and it was on these that I had heard of it and decided that I'd like to see it. I found it on DVD at the rental store last night, and since they didn't have anything else I really wanted, I brought it home.</p><p>The movie is very hard to follow. The different characters come at you quite quickly, and they are somewhat hard to distinguish from each other. The look and the feel of the movie is quite beautiful, but I found this probably worked against distinguishing people, and the only way I really started to break people down was because of the layout of their rooms. Another contributing factor to this is that the entire film is shot from the same distance, so that you have a small pan of the room, with very few close-ups. Without the close-ups, it was hard to really distinguish faces that would have helped know who was who.</p><p>I guess I would have to say that the camera work and the editing were the worst parts of the film. They were distracting enough that I had trouble paying attention. And, EVERY scene cuts with a fade. That really got on my nerves. Camera work can and should be used to enhance the film, and someone here just didn't get that.</p><p>As for story, it didn't pull me in at all. The real flesh of the film for me hits you early on, and although it gets emphasized bit-by-bit throughout the movie, it isn't enough. What I mean here is the whole situation that the flower girls are in is a hopeless trap of economic dominance, no matter how much \"power\" they are thought to have. A side character explains this well at the very start of the movie.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. There may be people who would like it, but I could not see enough merit to judge who that kind of person might be.</p>
80075|tron|DVD at home|2001-08-25|<p>I loved this film as a kid, and it easily ranked up there as my favorite movie for a while. What I don't understand, and don't yet fully comprehend, is why this movie has such a bad rap. I know that it is occasionally the butt of jokes, and I remember a <strong>Simpsons</strong> episode where no one will admit to seeing it (except Chief Wiggam). As far as I know, it is the first real hacker movie, which is enough of a reason for me to go back and watch it again.</p><p>The movie is classic. It is amazing what they did with the graphics, of course, but even the rest of the film stands up well, I feel. It isn't a complex idea, and there are a couple points where they just get silly, but otherwise things are solid. I joking referred to the movie to a couple friends as the early history of Microsoft, only the good guys won.</p><p>I still stand by my childhood desire to have a light-cycle. Those things rock. That bring me to my next point, which is the wonderful use of computer terminology throughout the film. I think Tron was even the name of a security program written back in the '70s, but I cannot find the article I read many years ago about that. And the whole internet theme here made it feel at the end like the <a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/\" title=\"Free Software Foundation\">FSF</a> had won the war.</p><p>Complaints about the film. I don't really have any. Obviously, there are times when the computer-human interaction is unrealistic (the command line interface is absurd), but I can understand why those changes were made, because only a handful of geeks would have been able to relate then. Otherwise, the movie is just fun to watch.</p><p>Don't worry about any of the crap you've heard about this film. If you are at all interested in either computer or sci-fi (don't they tend to  go hand-in-hand?), you should see this movie. Even if you aren't into these things, if you like action and good special effects, rent the DVD today, the quality is excellent.</p>
80076|madmax|DVD at home|2001-08-25|<p>I'd seen this classic movie many years ago, after having seen <strong>The Road Warrior</strong> many, many times as a young boy on whatever movie channel we had at the time (must have been about '84 or '85). And recently I started thinking that I need to see the aforementioned film again, so when I saw this one at the video store, it made sense to me to see them in order.</p><p>This is a fun movie, with a simple plot, but one well done. It some ways, it is quite amazing how brutal the film is, though of course most of the brutality takes place just off screen (and this in fact adds to the flavor of the film). And paybacks are hell. The movie might seem a bit slow to some, but I felt that it moved at a good pace.</p><p>My only real complaint about this film was that it was dubbed. The good news is that there are plans to put the original dialogue on an upcoming special edition release of the DVD, which at this point I'm very tempted to buy. The dubbing isn't so distracting to make the movie unwatchable, but it is quite obvious at points, and after all it is still English they are speaking (Hollywood decisions are often annoying like this).</p><p>If you haven't seen this film, or haven't seen it recently, then I certainly recommend it, though at this point I would say wait until this DVD release comes out, so you can catch it in all its glory (I mean, who doesn't recognize Mel Gibson's voice, and that this obviously isn't him).</p>
80077|mononoke|DVD at home|2001-08-26|<p>I've seen this movie already, although I have to say that it took me way too long to see it the first time (I missed it in the theaters). I knew it was going to be good before it was even released, since Miyazaki's films tend to be amazing anyway and then add onto that the setting of the film. My roommates rented it, and I was more than happy to sit through it again.</p><p>If you've never seen a Miyazaki film, you are missing something wonderful. The artwork and layout are amazing, and the color in this film will dazzle you. What makes it that much more amazing is how much of it is done by hand.</p><p>The story here is the best part of the film, though. There are no bad guys, as hard as that is to comprehend for most American film-goers. You have characters introduced which you want to see as the bad-guy, but then quickly you realize where they stand and why they are doing the things they are doing. There is as well the environmental message here, which is a little sad (how can an environmental message not be and be realistic) but interesting in that the whole balance of forces can only resolve in certain ways. On this level, the ending can certainly be disappointing and maybe even confusing to some, but I think it works out as best as it really can without passing into the absurd.</p><p>I highly recommend this film to everyone, regardless of their tastes. It will provide an excellent introduction into Japanese animation for those uninitiated, and straight enjoyment for everyone else.</p>
80078|jaynsilentbob|Mann Theater in Westwood|2001-08-26|<p>With the exception of <short=\"mallrats\" title=\"Mallrats\">Mallrats</a>, I've seen all of Kevin Smith's movies. In fact, I think I've seen <short=\"clerks\" title=\"Clerks\">Clerks</a> a total of three times, each time in the theater (that's a record for me). I loved that film when it came out, and highly recommend it to everyone. When I heard about this film, I wasn't nearly as enthusiastic, but when you've got time to kill on a Sunday afternoon and your across the street from the  theater, watching the movie doesn't sound like a bad idea.</p><p>I laughed pretty hard during this film. There was one point where my stomach was actually hurting from laughing so hard. I don't know when the last time I've laughed this much was. Much of the humor is rather crude, but Smith pulls it off very well. For example, there are a lot of gay jokes, but they are not done in a demeaning manner (towards gays, at least) but in a  way that really questions sexuality. You can see that there is an intelligent person behind the writing, not some 15-year-old boy. If you don't understand the difference, then don't see this film.</p><p>There are also a lot of jokes and jabs at other movies in this film. First off, if you haven't seen any of Kevin Smith's other films, then you are going to miss a lot of the jokes. That doesn't mean you won't find the movie funny, the person who joined me enjoyed it a lot, but it will enrich your viewing pleasure quite a bit. There are also great jabs at other recent, popular films and even Scooby Doo. The best of these has to be when Ben Affleck and Matt Damon begin poking at each other for the horrible movies they've done.</p><p>If you are at all inclined to see this movie, go do it. Certainly, there are some people who just won't like the film, either because they don't like the kind of humor or because they expect something more \"believable\" in the acting or script, but everyone else should have plenty of fun.</p>
80079|snatch|DVD at home|2001-08-27|<p>This is yet another one of those movies I would have liked to have seen in the theater, but the time just never materialized. I enjoyed <strong>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</strong> when I saw it some time ago, so I figured this movie would be as enjoyable. Besides, who can resist a good action-comedy, especially one done by some Brits.</p><p>Unlike some movies with too many characters, things here held together well. The flash introductions after the opening sequence scared me a bit,  because there's no way I'm going to remember all those names. Each of the characters, however, is developed well, with their own personalities and quirks. I wasn't disappointed with anyone's performance. Most of the characters are likeable, too.</p><p>The plot is: a huge diamond is stolen in Antwerp and finds its way to London for a few days. In an effort to either acquire or retain the gem, each of the characters becomes involved in some way. The web is quite tangled, but it is a joy to see it all begin to come together by the end. You get to know and like quite a few people, and they all do their part to make you laugh.</p><p>I don't have any serious complaints about the movie. For those of you who don't have an ear for \"pikey\" (something between English and Irish), there are even subtitles on the DVD for the parts where Brad Pitt speaks. The rest of the extras were rather unimpressive to me, and so I felt the second disc was a waste of time. There seems to be this trend in DVDs now to put on material about how the movies were made, almost from the perspective of how you folks at home could start working your way into Hollywood. For the most part I've found these uninteresting, with the exception of the 10 minute bit on the <short=\"mariachi\">El Mariachi</a> disc, which gave me some insight into how the film was made with such a small budget. But, storyboards bore me.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film. It's certainly worth the rental fee, though I cannot say it would be worth purchasing.</p>
80080|shining|DVD at home|2001-08-30|<p>I know that I saw this movie when I was very young, but I couldn't remember anything about it, except for the scene where the boy backtracks in the snow and then hides while his father passes him by in the maze. All my other knowledge of this film comes from the \"Shinning\" episode of <strong>The Simpsons</strong>, which I must say, makes for an interesting viewing of this film. Unfortunately, the DVD we rented was also those shit DVD's that were released following Kubrick's death in order to make a quick profit. What this means is that the picture is full screen, not wide-screen, and the quality hasn't been touched up or anything, so that you might as well be watching a video. I think some of Kubrick's films have been re-released, but I haven't gotten any word yet on the quality, so I'm holding off on that purchase of <short=\"fullmetaljacket\" title=\"Full Metal Jacket\">Full Metal Jacket</a> that I so dearly want to make.</p><p>I never read the book, nor much of Steven King for that matter, so I didn't come in with any expectations. I've heard that King wasn't pleased with Kubrick, but I could care less and don't know why. The film is enjoyable, and believe it is paced well and done with a proper amount of tension and artistry. And it is nice to see the time in which the film is made reflected in the movie itself.</p><p>The supernatural elements that cross here are kinda bizarre, but they work. First you have a hotel built on an Indian burial ground, making for bad luck from the get-go. This, I supposed, combined with the obvious decadence of the rich clientele who frequent such a place, makes for some evil spirits who seek to ever increase their ghostly parties. Nicholson's character, on top of this, is the manager of the hotel from the 1920s in addition to the reincarnated winter-time caretaker of 1980. No real explanation of why this is, but it makes his interaction with the spirits that much more interesting. And on top of this we have a kid and a cook who both have \"the shining,\" a psychic link that allows those who have it to communicate without talking.  It also allows the possessor to see spirits and things from the past. So, mix this all together, strand the family up in the mountains for five months, and you have a wonderful story of a man going \"insane\" and trying to axe the wife and kid. What more could you ask for?</p><p>I enjoyed the film. It isn't up there as one of the greatest, nor one I would buy (even if a decent edition did exist), but it is definitely worth seeing. Kubrick was generally a very good director with some exceptions, and this film is not a failing. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it in a long time, it's worth watching.</p>
80081|maboroshi|Video at home|2001-08-31|<p>I've noticed this video in the rental stores for years, but never been motivated enough to rent it. I suppose it is because I've never heard anything about it. But, I do like to keep up with some Japanese films. My problem is that I cannot get into \"foreign\" films much anymore, since for the most part anything in the foreign section of most rental stores is an art film.</p><p>This is an art film. It would probably be very beautiful to watch on a  large screen. It is very slow, the pacing just drags at all times. The story is hard to follow, you are never completely sure what is going on until the end, when you realize that you aren't supposed to be able to figure out what is going on. And, like other art movies I've complained of recently, the camera doesn't close in on the actors very often, if at all. You really don't get a good look at the main character until later in the film (her face is much clearer on the video box), and the other characters are the same way, such that you only get one decent look at her husband's face before he snuffs it.</p><p>I cannot say I hated this film. Just don't go watching it expecting a story. It is a little statement on life, relationships, understanding, and death. It isn't going to be clear to most, and it isn't a satisfying movie. Probably the endearing part of the movie to me was the language, since they speak a Kansai dialect that I'm more familiar with. Without that, I'm not sure what I would think about this movie.</p><p>I cannot recommend this film to anyone. There isn't enough merit in there for me to put anyone through it. It isn't even depressing, it is just there, and I guess that is why it fails for me.</p>
80082|groundhogday|Video at home|2001-09-01|<p>I watched this movie on video some time ago, more-or-less by accident. I  don't even remember the circumstances, but I do remember that I didn't really have a good impression of this movie when it was released in theaters, so it wasn't one I was looking out for. I found it funny when I saw it before, and after seeing the trailer for it elsewhere recently, felt it would be a good film for my girlfriend and I to sit through, since she hadn't seen it.</p><p>The premise is that Bill Murray's character (the typical asshole that he plays) is a news weatherman who get trapped in Punxsutawney, PA on February 2, doomed to repeat the day indefinitely. The obvious catch is, of course, that he has to overcome his jerk tendencies and win the woman of his dreams, the TV producer who he tends to grate against. This scenario creates an interesting situation, which the writers did a good job of exploring, in that what would you do if you could do anything knowing that it would all be erased when you woke up the next morning... on the same day. He plays the field, gathers information, robs a bank truck, and eventually even tries to kill himself.</p><p>This is just a well done movie. The humor is mixed up well with the romantic element, and the concept is just fresh enough to pull you in. There isn't much more to say. If you like these kinds of elements in a film, then I'd recommend it to you. In any case, it makes a good movie to watch with someone else.</p>
80083|excalibur|Video at home|2001-09-02|<p>I don't think I've ever seen this film. I have vague notions that I've seen parts of it, probably on movie channels or something, since a couple scenes I could remember, but I certainly didn't see much more than that. I've been reading <strong>The Mists of Avalon</strong> lately, and am about a third through that tome, so along with my interest in the Dark Ages and in the Arthurian legends, I decided to watch it.</p><p>I made a mistake. This film really isn't worth watching. The acting is fairly decent for some of the character, but that's about where it ends for me. I guess part of the problem is that it must be based on the different legends that were written in the Middle Ages. Arthur, unfortunately, is situated in about the 400s, not the 1200s, and I'm all too aware of that to enjoy this film that much.</p><p>The first thing that set me off, and made it impossible for me to take the movie seriously, was the armor. Plate mail did not exist when Arthur was around. And even if it had, I'm sure it wouldn't have been so shiny (and amazingly light-weight, since one character does NOT sink like a rock when he falls in water). And they always have this armor on. What's up with that? I just happen to feel comfortable in full-plate while I'm relaxing, eating,  and most of all when I'm having sex (funny scene, let me tell you). This movie is fantasy all the way, without a touch of reality.</p><p>Merlin, Morgana and the lady of the lake are all a bit disturbing as well. Their motivation as characters is always suspect and unconvincing. Then you have some wild lines by Merlin which are just out of nowhere. The acting here doesn't help. The role of magic in the movie is just odd from the beginning, though the whole dragon concept is interesting as an independent idea.</p><p>I'm really sorry I sat though this film. There are so many things to complain about (Igraine's dancing... what is that. She's the wife of a Duke!) that I could go on for a long while. But I'll restrain myself and just say: Don't waste your two-and-a-half hours on this crap. I'm not sure any good Arthurian movies have been made, but the paucity is no reason to force yourself through the few their are.</p>
80084|sies|Video at home|2001-09-04|<p>Well, for a long time this has been sitting over my head. One Jackie Chan film which I have not seen but everyone agrees I should (well, everyone who is a Jackie fan would). I think this puts me at something like 45 of his films that I have seen, and the rest are not worth mentioning. It was certainly fortunate that my local video store had it, otherwise there's no telling how long I could have put this off.</p><p>This is the movie that made Jackie a star, and if you've seen his earlier films from the seventies, you can certainly see the difference. It is funny, but the choreography is also very well done, bringing out the physical humor that was just completely absent from his earlier films.</p><p>An Eagle Claw master has killed all but the last 3 proponents of the Snake Fist style when the movie begins, and our first fight scene is the death of the last master. The final two masters go into hiding (we never really see one of them until he is dead). Meanwhile, Jackie is a lowly house-boy at a kung fu school who gets the job of punching bag whenever a demonstration is called for. He \"helps\" out an old man who is getting beat up, and this eventually leads to the old man (one of the two remaining Snake masters) teaching Jackie the Snake Fist. The climax is, of course, when the Eagle Claw master tracks down the remaining Snake fighters for a final battle.</p><p>Half of the enjoyment of this film is not Jackie, but the old man (who is Yuen Woo-Ping's father, a master of the Chinese Opera). Both of these fellows are very acrobatic, and their imitation of a snake is quite enjoyable. As for real kung fu, well this movie is classic technique battles of the  seventies. Many of the techniques are clearly contrived, but interesting nonetheless. Probably the most disturbing thing is that the conclusion is that the Snake style is inferior to the Eagle Claw, and thus needs the infusion of the Cat's Paw \"style.. Not that there's necessarily anything wrong or inaccurate about this, but it does come across wrong to me. I'd be interested to hear an evaluation of the martial arts in the film, since we also see an Mantis style as well as some other southern styles which remain unidentified to the English-speaking audience.</p><p>Obviously, this film is not for everyone. If you don't enjoy old-school Hong Kong action films or Jackie Chan, why would you ever watch it. But for those of us with a love for the aforementioned films, it is a must-see. If nothing else, because it is just plain old fun.</p>
80085|zu|DVD at home|2001-09-07|<p>I've seen this classic of the wuxia genre before. On reviewing, I have a better sense of the place of this film. It is really the beginning, in terms of special effects. Sure, there were some attempts in the 60s, but I've not seen any 70s films which even attempt to do this sort of wire-flying stuntwork. This really is one of the first, particularly with the combination of \"martial arts\" with sci-fi style special effects.</p><p>This movie has to be understood in its context, otherwise no one will like it. The wire work is early, primitive, not yet refined as it is in the plethora of films from the late 80s, early 90s. There are times when the motion is choppy, due undoubtedly to editing. The special effects are about as good as you could get for 1983.</p><p>Our hero is a soldier who is just dissatisfied with all the suffering and war that is going on. When he encounters a swordsman of supreme skill, he figures it is the duty of that swordsman to help end the misery. He quickly gets involved in the battle against evil, where a blood demon is trying to  take material form once again and wreak havoc upon the puny humans that inhabit this planet. This all takes place is a unidentified historical period.</p><p>The plot is a jumble and hard to connect together into a coherent whole at times. There is a thread which connects many things, but to many it will be very easy to miss that thread. The acting is nothing to shout about, neither wonderful or horrible. The translations help spice up the humor. The action is mostly soft and effects driven, with most of the swordplay being rather tame in presentation of any real skill.</p><p>I think I can only recommend this movie to people already introduced to the genre. It gets rather silly at times, and if you tend to take movies seriously, definitely don't rent this. If you enjoy the wuxia genre, then pick this up. Another reason to check this film out is that they are making a \"sequel\" to it now, though how much of the sequel will be based on the  first one I do not know.</p>
80086|truth|DVD at home|2001-09-11|<p>I'd had this film recommended to me a while back by someone over who actually came across these pages and liked them. If that isn't a good enough recommendation, what is. Anyway, I had to trek up to my old rental store to get this, since no one near me carries it. Luckily their rentals are for 6 days, so I don't have to travel back unnecessarily. I had the day off of work on Tuesday, so what better opportunity to watch a film.</p><p>This is a romance, which isn't even close to my forte. Sam, a fellow from Singapore, is working for a sleazy magazine in Hong Kong, snapping unseemly photos for a living. One night he comes across Jane and becomes intrigued by her. He ends up approaching her under the context of doing a story on her, and ends up spending all his time with her. Jane, being a young drug addict who lives by conning people, is quite different in character from Sam, a shy, educated guy who doesn't even seem to drink much.</p><p>The film and the acting are quite well done. There are some superb shots which really help capture the emotion or feeling in a scene. Both Jane and Sam come across as believable characters. This all helps you relate to them as humans, and feel for them through their hard times. For the most part, the plot elements are believable (the crucial element of how the movie ends does go over the top).</p><p>I liked this movie a lot. Although the actors are attractive in their own way, they aren't your drop-dead gorgeous types which tend to turn me off in a movie of this nature. There are different messages in the movie about how to interact with other people and how we relate to ourselves and our pasts. The movie is also quite funny at times, mixed in well with the drama. One scene that sticks out for me right now is one where Sam complains about his arm going numb from the way Jane is sleeping... that one really hits home.</p><p>I would recommend this film to most. Obviously, action addicts (I know people who cannot sit through a movie which isn't fast-paced) aren't going to enjoy it, but I think most will. My only real complaint about the movie would simply be that sometimes the subtitles come a bit fast at you while you are trying to catch the action, but this is easily cured. It's a moving movie about how people can change.</p>
80087|inspector|Video at home|2001-09-14|<p>This is one of those films I've heard of a long time ago, but just never got around to watching. Other than being produced by Jackie Chan, I had heard of it as a classic in the women kicking ass genre of Hong Kong films. That last one should be reason enough, right?</p><p>Plot-wise, this movie is a bit odd. We start out with a couple senior female officers involved in a sting, then after some claims that women might be better at certain jobs, a special unit is set up. The bulk of the film is then occupied with these women going through training and their social lives in the meantime. Then we leap in the end from women who clearly are not ready for deployment being thrown into a highly sensitive jewel heist. Throughout we have male-female tension which is nonsensical and mostly just sexist.</p><p>There are some decent fight scenes in the movie, at the beginning and the end, where we see some creative tactics used. Mostly, this film is a comedy, with a musical interlude thrown in in the middle for no apparent reason (maybe the writers had just watched <strong>Grease</strong> or something). The problem is, the comedy in this movie isn't very good. There are  certainly some funny scenes, but a lot of the humor really isn't impressive. The sexism, of course, just makes things that much worse.</p><p>I cannot recommend this film. I won't say I didn't laugh or even enjoy the film at times, but I wouldn't watch it again. It is cheesy at best. I'll be on the lookout for better comedies, something has to turn up.</p>
80088|ashesoftime|DVD at home|2001-09-15|<p>I've only seen one other Wong Kar-Wai film before, so I wasn't too sure about this film from the get go. I've heard of it from somewhere, and decided to rent it, since it was on DVD. I expected a moody and artistic film, but the description seemed to promise Hong Kong style action.</p><p>This movie was hard to follow at first. It is in fact three stories  intertwined with a forth story. You have a swordsman who lives in the desert and hires out other swordsmen for jobs. Adding to the confusion is a story where Brigitte Lin plays her classic male/female role, supposedly as brother and sister. Through the haze there are some interesting tales, but they are still mired in the camerawork that helps confuse things.</p><p>An action movie this is not. I was really surprised to see that Sammo Hung had done the fight choreography on this. The reason for the surprise was not that the fighting wasn't any good, but that the audience could never see any of it. Why put such effort into quality fight scenes if you aren't going to film them so people can tell what's going on.</p><p>There are messages in the film about human existence, in particular about what it means to waste one's life versus accomplishing something. It is precisely in their efforts to accomplish something that the main swordsman wastes his and his love's lives. The others are a bit more fortunate. On this level, then, I guess this film can best be categorized as a love story / tragedy.</p><p>I wouldn't tell anyone to go out and rent this film. I supposed if you are really into Wong Kar-Wai already, you will get what you expect. Otherwise I don't think the film is worth the time spent watching it; I didn't come away from the film with a sense of understanding or having gained something. To boot, the subtitling was horrible, rarely in synch with the audio so that you couldn't even tell who was saying what often times.</p>
80089|topsecret|Video at home|2001-09-16|<p>I haven't seen this film since I was in high school. Back then, I had a greater appreciation for Abrahams and Zucker films, and have perhaps seen most of them. My roommate wanted a comedy, and this was on our list of old films we want to see or see again.</p><p>In an effort to divert the world's attention from some diabolic plans, the East German government brings in U.S. rock-and-roll star Nick Rivers to perform at a cultural festival. Nick gets embroiled in the plot, and eventually helps to prevent the East Germans from getting their hands on the anti-submarine weapon which a kidnapped scientist is working on.</p><p>I guess I'm too old for this humor. Most of the jokes just seems childish and stale to me. Many of the jokes were just downright bad. The East Germans are depicted as something of a cross between the Nazis and Stalinist shock troops, all with their bad accents. Certainly there were parts which were funny (Skeet Shootin') but most of it was forced and excessive. There is one joke where Val's character actually says that \"It all sounds like some sort of bad movie.. It would be funny if it wasn't true.</p><p>This humor has its limits, and I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Not that some people might not like it, but there are better examples of the genre to sample from.</p>
80090|twinkle|Video at home|2001-09-18|<p>This is another movie recommended to me over e-mail (shout out to Lorri), that I very likely would have never heard of otherwise. It's a Hong Kong comedy filled with a number of famous people (in HK at least). Now if only I could figure out why they insist on releasing HK movies on two separate videos, instead of sticking them all on the same tape. Do they make more money this way?</p><p>I didn't know what to expect with this one, so it really throws you for a loop when the movie starts. The scene is heaven, and all the gods and fairies and just hanging out, doing their thing. The Wind-fall god happens to see the Angle of Nine Heavens and falls in love with her. After a series of events, the Angel and her lover, St. Michael, are sentenced to live on Earth. Because the Wind-fall god wants to rescue her, he goes to Earth to find her, but must seek the assistance of one of his followers (\"fans\"). He gets involved in a gambling competition in order to impress the earthly manifestation of the Angel, and everything follows from there.</p><p>I'll start of with my complaints about this movie. Actually, my complaint. There was a bit of information that was just not translated for those of us who cannot speak and read Cantonese. In particular, many of the gods up in heaven are labeled when they are introduced, but you never learn who they are unless someone actually calls them by name. I'm sure there were some good jokes here that I might have even gotten had I understood who was who. That's my only complaint.</p><p>The movie is a lot of fun. At many times it is just downright silly, but this works in with the atmosphere of the movie in general, and the story still comes across as believable. Furthermore, for those who have seen the more famous Hong Kong films, there are a number of references in here to cause a smile (unfortunately, I still need to see <short=\"godofgamblers\" title=\"God of Gamblers\">God of Gamblers</a> which I could definitely see referenced). The characters are quite interesting, particularly Anita Yuen and her master chiropractoring.</p><p>Even if you aren't familiar with HK flicks, I'd recommend this film. It helps to know a little something about Chinese religion (the references do make sense!), but I think a lot of people can enjoy the film anyway.</p>
80091|younganddangerous|DVD at home|2001-09-24|<p>At the risk of embarrassment, I have to admit that I've never seen this film before. It is probably the most famous triad film to come out of Hong Kong, and this is attested to by the fact that there are something like 10 or more sequels and spin-offs which have been made of it since its release. I must admit that triad films aren't exactly something I've watched a lot of, so I'm in no position to compare, just to watch.</p><p>The film starts with a brief scene in 1985, where the protagonists are just about 14 years old and playing soccer outside there tenement. After advertently kicking their ball near Ugly Kwan, a triad boss, they get the tar kicked out of them. Another boss, B, takes them under his wing, and we are moved up to 1995, where the friends are now \"rascals\" on the streets of Hong Kong, beating up, killing and doing just about anything else that a young thug might do (like take care of parking for the night clubs). Nam is clearly being primed for a leadership position, and the story centers around that and the conflict between Kwan and B within the triad.</p><p>I like the movie a lot. The violence is actually quite tamed down from what I expected. Not that you don't have some blood, but most of the film is plot and character development. This is most certainly a sympathetic portrayal of the triads, while showing the tensions and rivalries that go on. In the end, though, you are supposed to understand that there is honor among thieves and that some of these people are genuinely good guys (you see very little drugs in the film, of course, or anything else besides gambling and porno production).</p><p>There are some loose ends and plot gaps which hold back the realism a little in addition to the fact that the protagonists are just nice guys, but otherwise, the story flows nicely. There's a lot of humor which comes across well, and I loved the Stammer (GiGi Lai) who is not only attractive but plays a wonderful role.</p><p>The one complaint I can think of is the one which ALL subtitled films seem guilty of, i.e. not translating text you see on screen. At the start of the movie, there is a long piece which must be backgrounds on what the triads are, but all I could understand was a date (1956 or so, I cannot remember) and a couple other words. There are a couple of other cases of this too. I still got what was going on, and in fact learned a lot of words for things I've understood before, but just didn't know what to call it (\"red pocket\" is a good example).</p><p>I recommend the film. It may not be for everyone, but I think most would enjoy it. It seems to be based on a popular comic book (which I'm unfamiliar with), so the story was tested before it went to the screen. It's worth checking out, especially considering how influential it has been on Hong Kong cinema of the last 6 years or so.</p>
80092|lastdragon|DVD at home|2001-09-29|<p>I had never heard of this film growing up. I'm not sure how that happened, because I would have been 10 or 11 when this movie came out. My best guess is that it is still black cinema, and for the most part they didn't show that in my home town. I don't think they even played <strong>Malcolm X</strong> there. There were only about 5 black families in the town when I grew up, so I guess they could easily assume no demand, but I'm sure racism played its part as well (it surely played a role in why there were only 5 families). So I just outright bought this movie on DVD. I'd heard enough good things about it, and not just from people who liked martial art films, but from people who certainly don't have a clue about how to fight.</p><p>This film is thoroughly enmeshed in the year it was made. You have some breakdancing in the background, rap is just starting to take off, and dance and music shows are certainly doing well. Leroy Green, referred to as Bruce Leroy by those who know of him, has been training for some time with his master and has graduated to the final stage, where his master can no longer teach him more. Because his skill is known throughout Harlem, the local Shogun, Sho'nuff, wants to challenge him to a fight to show whose the \"master.\" Meanwhile, Leroy gets involved in a plot by a wannabe promoter who decides to kidnap the host of a local dance show in order to force his videos onto the air.</p><p>A lot of things in this movie are meant to be campy. Although there is an attempt to make some decent fights (they aren't that wonderful), mostly the movie is cheesy plot and humor, which is exactly what one expects. Sho'nuff's entourage is patently absurd, but fits in just fine. The fact that Leroy runs around in outdated Chinese fashion will a paddy-hat on but cocked back is also deliciously absurd, matching the naivete of the character, oblivious to the real world around him and how it operates. This guy eats everything with chopsticks, like some little kid who's just learned about them.</p><p>The movie is a lot of fun. You don't watch it for serious drama or high quality martial arts. For that matter, like most American films, there is no distinction between Japanese and Chinese arts and culture. He is wearing Chinese clothes and imitates some Chinese mannerisms, but the wall of his studio has the word \"karate\" written in Japanese, and he bows like in the Japanese arts.</p><p>I'd recommend the film to most people. I'm sure a lot of people are not going to like it, and anyone without an appreciation for cheezy movies should stay away. Otherwise, for those of us old enough to remember the early eighties and who haven't seen the film, check it out.</p>
80093|muppetmovie|DVD at home|2001-09-30|<p>I'm a huge Muppets fan. I can honestly say that <strong>The Muppet Show</strong> was my favorite show as a kid, and this movie is certainly the best example of why the show was so cool.</p><p>Kermit is sitting in a swamp down in the Everglades when a Hollywood agent happens along and informs him about auditions for frogs taking place in the near future. At the idea of making millions of people happy, Kermit sets off for Hollywood. He picks up a number of new friends along the way, rounding out most of the cast from the show. He also gets hunted by Doc Hopper, a restaurant owner who wants to use Kermit as his spokesman to sell frog legs.</p><p>I'm not the best person at describing things, but Muppet humor is unique. There's a pleasant mix of site gags, puns, cultural references, and cameos by various famous actors and comedians. The music is wonderful. \"Rainbow Connection,\" \"Movin' Right Along,\" \"Hope That Something Better Comes Along,\" and the song which Gonzo sings near the end of the film are all classics, and should I ever get off my lazy butt, I might even purchase the soundtrack if it is available.</p><p>The DVD is nice. Not a lot of extras, but the transfer is good, and there are \"screen tests\" which appear to have been made in the U.K. There are little jokes in there that you'd never see in the show, but which really are in the vein of Muppet humor.</p><p>This is the greatest Muppet movie ever made, and certainly up there as one of the best G-rated films ever made. I recommend it to everyone, even if there aren't enough scenes with Waldorf and Statler and the Swedish Chef in  them. Enjoy this masterpiece every now and then, it's worth it.</p>
80094|molly|DVD at home|2001-09-30|<p>This is a movie I'd never heard of in my life until my roommate rented it. From the description I got, it sounded like one of those feel-good life story movies where someone who hasn't ever had to deal with adversity learns the \"true\" meaning of love, friendship, etc. through a long absent relative with some medical condition who suddenly gets thrust into their life.</p><p>I wasn't wrong. This movie is as formulaic as you can expect. Buck has a sister Molly who is autistic, who has lived in a home since their parents died some 10 or 15 years earlier. Now that the home is closing down, Buck has to find some way to take care of Molly. Shortly thereafter, Molly is able to undergo some experimental surgery that begins to alleviate her condition, allowing her to learn new things she's always been cut off from. In the end, of course, we know that this experimental procedure isn't going to last, and everyone has to come to terms with what that means.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't horrible. It has some quite funny scenes and some interesting interactions that the scenario enables. Unfortunately, most of the movie is overtly emotionally manipulative, with a handful of moral messages to throw in our faces. I don't regret having sit through the movie (I wasn't feeling like doing anything on a Sunday afternoon anyway), but I wouldn't watch the film again.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. If you haven't heard of it already, there's no reason to look it up. The acting is decent, but the  story is tired.</p>
80095|ditto|DVD at home|2001-10-02|<p>I'd never heard of this movie until a week ago. I was browsing through DVDs for sale and started looking through the Korean films. This one caught my eye because of the time the film is supposed to take place, i.e. that one of the two people is living in 1979, amid the various turmoil that was going on in South Korea at that time. Honestly, that was enough to get me interested.</p><p>I haven't seen the movie <short=\"frequency\">Frequency</a>, which was released earlier the same year, but this movie is clearly borrowing from it. A woman in 1979 gets hold of a HAM radio basically by accident. She has a serious crush on another student who has just returned from the army and ends up picking up the radio as a cover story. One night a voice comes over the radio, and she begins communicating with a man in the year 2000, though of course she doesn't know it at first. The film is essentially about relationships and love, but the story is told through a sci-fi touched medium that makes for a very intersting plot.</p><p>I was very moved by this story. It wasn't simply that the main actress, Kim Ha-Neul, is one of the most wholesomely attractive women I've seen on film in a long time. The twists of events are a pleasure to watch as they unfold on screen. I honestly found my eyes beginning to water at a few points, it was just so easy to relate to the characters. In the end, there really wasn't much in the way of current political events (things have changed in South Korea, but not that much) that moved the story, but I didn't mind it at all.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone, because most of the people I know are more into action films, but I definitely recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a good love story. The real problem is going to be getting hold of this movie, because I've never seen it in a video store and Korean films in general just don't get played in the U.S., and I live in Los Angeles, which I'm certain has the largest Korean-American community in the U.S.</p>
80096|cgs|Video at home|2001-10-05|<p>I've already seen this <short=\"cgs\">film</a>, but re-watched it as part of my friend's Friday night Hong Kong movie research. There isn't much for me to add from what I've said before, except maybe that the film is still just as good upon second viewing, if not a little better.</p>
80097|juliet|James Bridge Theater at UCLA|2001-10-06|<p>The second film of a double feature in the Hong Kong Neon series at UCLA, this was the West Coast premiere of this film. I don't remember having heard of it before hand, but when I read the synopsis / review, it sounded like it would be a pretty good film. Besides, I paid for it anyway, so there's no reason I wouldn't stay for it. And, although I've only seen Francis Ng in a couple movies so far, I've enjoyed his acting.</p><p>Francis's character is something of a street thug, but certainly not one of the most skillful or successful ones. Together with his friend, he as quite a few gambling debts. Sandra's character has had a mastectomy, and after her divorce is without anyone save her elderly grandfather. The two of them meet for the first time at a restaurant where Sanrda works as a hostess. The boss of the fellow Francis owes money to essentially brings these two together, though through no conscious action himself.</p><p>This movie is essentially a romance. The relationship between the two characters develops very, very slowly. There is plenty of humor, but for the most part the most moving scenes are sobering ones. These two are not well off. They are working class nobodies who have little to rely on, and their circumstances are quite bleak.</p><p>I really liked this film. The acting was superb, especially since I know that these two actors are more known for different kinds of roles (comedy and triad boss). The other nice thing for me, as always, was that Sandra is not your typical knockout, drop-dead gorgeous actress. She has an attractiveness of her own, but I felt that her looks were more in accord with the role she was playing.</p><p>I most certainly recommend this film, though I have to say that you shouldn't go in expecting a movie to uplift the spirit. The ending is good, but it is also realistic.</p>
80098|victim|James Bridge Theater at UCLA|2001-10-06|<p>UCLA in conjunction with the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in San Francisco ran a series of Hong Kong films at UCLA starting Wednesday and running through Sunday. With one exception, I have not see any of the films. Fortunately, I had heard of several of them, so they were already on my  radar when it came to my attention that they were going to be shown. This film is one of them, which I read a synopsis of some time ago and had put on my list of possible rentals. Luckily, I got to see it on the big screen instead. This was the U.S. premiere of the film.</p><p>This is a crime thriller, which pulls in some horror elements. An unemployed computer engineer is kidnapped and recovered by the police from a \"haunted\" house. As the police investigate, it becomes unclear who the victim really is. Manson, our kidnapee, seemingly looses it after his abduction, avoiding the police and dealing with his own financial problems. There isn't a lot more I can say about the film on the plot level, because part of the enjoyment of watching the film are the plot twists and turns as they are slowly revealed at the climax.</p><p>The movie is filled with solid actors and is a pleasure to watch. There's a little humor thrown in (the funniest being the most unexpected) to keep the pacing perfect. The atmosphere in the film is excellent, and don't worry, the elements which seem supernatural are resolved in a realistic manner, so you are not expected to suspend any disbelief.</p><p>I recommend this film highly. It is thoroughly enjoyable to watch. It is available on video (and probably DVD, I haven't checked) and is within reach to anyone who normally can get to decent Hong Kong films. Only diclaimer is that, like most non-fantasy or comedy films from Hong Kong, don't expect a happy ending.</p>
80099|rosencrantz|Video at home|2001-10-06|<p>My roommates' own this on video, so it was only a matter of time before I watched it. I've heard it referred to by a few people, but didn't really know what I was getting into when I popped it in the machine. I'm not complaining, I just didn't know what to expect beyond intellectual stimulation.</p><p>Basically this is <strong>Hamlet</strong> through the eyes of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. I have to admit that I do not remember the play all that well, not having revisited it since High School, but remembered enough of it to pick up on most of the references when they came along. Essentially, our two protagonists are sought out in order to help Hamlet get to the root cause of Hamlet's madness. Along the way, they meet up with tragedians, headed by Dreyfuss, who play the Shakespearean fool (read insightful input) to our pair.</p><p>Oldman and Roth are excellent actors, and the interaction between them is wonderful to watch. For me it was refreshing to see Oldman NOT playing a villain, since most of the movies in which I've seen him, if not all up to this point, he has played the bad guy. The movie itself is quite funny, though I have to say that the coin tossing will probably be the most memorable in the long run.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film, although if you are like me and haven't seen or read <strong>Hamlet</strong> recently I might recommend catching it first, just so the plot and references are more firmly in place. I'd like to say I'll review it myself soon, but I doubt that will happen.</p>
80100|spackedout|James Bridge Theater at UCLA|2001-10-07|<p>This is another movie that had hit my radar a while back, but that I just hadn't sought out yet. Although I haven't seen any of the male-centered lost-youth films from Hong Kong that this film is a bounce off of, the idea itself of a film with a sympathetic look at life for today's high school aged girls in Hong Kong was interesting enough for me.</p><p>Essentially, this is a slice of life of four teenage (maybe 16) girls in the New Territories, all from homes with either abusive or absent parents. They aren't college bound, but otherwise they seem to sit somewhere in the middle of the mix. One girl participates in party-lines, and is known for her sexual promiscuity. Another girl is more reserved, but has finally lost her virginity to a guy who has now basically disappeared, and now she's pregnant. The other two girls are a lesbian couple, falling into the traditional butch-femme roles that movies like to show (and less mature lesbians seem to fall into). The femme is quite flirtatious and causes quite a bit of jealousy from her lover, who doesn't back down from a confrontation.</p><p>Part of the interest of this film to me is how similar it is to what I know of Japanese youth and culture today. The role of cell phones and the culture of pedophilia are just a couple examples. It is also interesting in how clearly it shows who these girls are. They are still obsessed and surround themselves with the icons of childhood. They hang out at a candy store, their rooms are filled with dolls and other girlish accoutrements. At the same time, they are dealing with sex and relationships, although on their own yet immature level. The film itself covers events that allow them to grow a little, though at the end there isn't any kind of happy veneer to make you think that things are really going to improve significantly.</p><p>This film isn't for everyone. For American film-goers, if you like films like <strong>Kids</strong>, then you will be interested in this film. In particularly you can see the contrasts (or lack thereof) between Hong Kong and the U.S. Probably the aspect of this film that lets it rise above other films of this genre is that it doesn't seem to fade into voyeurism.</p>
80101|clerks|DVD at home|2001-10-09|<p>OK, this movie holds my personal record for the most times seen in a theater. I saw it when it premiered in Chicago, and then went to see it when it actually got wide-scale release, and then saw it a third time because I was the usher (on a volunteer basis) at the campus theater when they did their second run. I haven't watched the film since then, but many of the lines are still fresh in my head (in part due to the soundtrack). Having found out that my roommate had never seen the movie, I had to correct this serious problem.</p><p>The plot is simple: a day in the life of a convenience store clerk and his friend who works at the video store next door. Dante is the kind of person who all too willingly gives in to the needs / demands / whims of others. The story starts with him being asked to open the store, despite having closed the night before. He bends his plans in order to accommodate the owner. It just keeps getting worse as the day goes on. Randal, his friend, fortunately has a much better outlook on the situation, and their interaction is the center of the film.</p><p>Besides the humor of the film, which I found to be superb, I guess the reason I liked it so much is because I can relate to Dante all too well. I'm not quite as extreme, but I certainly have some of the same failings and could therefore extract more from the movie than just some excellent punchlines. The added bonus is the soundtrack, which is quite good.</p><p>This movie rocks. If you have not seen this (or any Kevin Smith) film, then get off your ass and rent it today. Once you've seen it, then you should start going through the rest of his movies, because they build upon each other, with an excellent climax (?) in <short=\"jaynsilentbob\">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</a>. There's only one more movie of the series that I need to see, and hopefully it will show up here in the near future.</p>
80102|eriktheviking|Video at home|2001-10-13|<p>This is a classic. I've seen it a number of times and have a copy of my own, though I hadn't watched it in quite some time. We were sitting around the dinner table talking about gods and their relationship to humans. I'm an atheist, so I was using the opportunity to make fun of the egocentric and self-important view humans have of religion. Thus, this movie came to mind, as I thought about the final scenes in Asgard. It was agreed that we should watch the film.</p><p>Norse mythology, as well as Dark Ages and Viking history hold a near and dear place in my heart. If I had to do it all over again, one of my alternative lives would be research into the subject matter. In any case, it should be clear that any film which draws so heavily upon this is going to have a leg up for me anyway.</p><p>Erik, during a expedition, begins to question the point of everything, the need for the violence and rape. As this is the age of Ragnarok, Erik decides to get an expedition together to find the Horn Resounding, which will allow them to visit the gods in the Halls of Valhalla, waking them up so that Fenrir can be chased from the sky and the violence of the human world brought to an end. This journey leads them west, in search of Hybrasil, but not without the hindrance of those forces which need Ragnarok to make their living.</p><p>This film is very intelligent and well put together. Many different aspects of the Viking way of life and their beliefs are pulled in and used to effective ends. The film is a comedy, but it also has a lot to say about humanity and religion. One of the best characters is the christian missionary, who through single-minded devotion to his religion cannot even see the horrors that the vikings around him are facing. I can only surmise that the one magical item which does affect the monk is a statement about the naivete of christians.</p><p>This is one of the greats, and I would certainly recommend it to everyone, even if you are not generally interested in the Norsemen. It is directed and stars several of the old Python cast, and their wonderful brand of humor shines throughout. Tim Robbins is also a great actor, who tends to pick quality roles for himself, and this is no exception.</p>
80103|hesawoman|Video at home|2001-10-13|<p>I had heard of this movie a while ago, and after seeing <short=\"twinkle\">Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Star</a> I had a better sense of who Anita Yuen was and a desire to see some of her other films. I'd heard that this was one of the top comedies when it was released, and one of the more well-known films on the list I was looking at. I've really been in the mood for more non-action Hong Kong films, so this fit the bill.</p><p>Anita's character (Wing) is a tom-boyish woman who is one of the uber-fans of Sam and Rose, a record producer and canto-pop star, respectively. Obviously, there is a lot of tabloid attention paid to the relationship between these two, but the relationship is on the rocks. Wing manages to start her singing career disguised as a man when Sam holds open auditions. She/he is quickly thrust into their lives, and despite a desire to see her two favorite stars together, she is also falling in love with Sam.</p><p>The film is loaded with reference to the canto-pop industry and the fans who are obsessed with it. I have to say that I am not that familiar with the scene, so although I did get a number of jokes, there were probably things I was missing. The film is also loaded with sexuality jokes, with male and female as well as straight and gay all put on the line. The film also tries to be touching, although I think it doesn't meet its expectations here.</p><p>I liked the film, but wouldn't watch it again. A lot of the film is just outright cheesy, but not the enduring kind of cheesy that brings you back to some movies over and over again. I probably wouldn't recommend the film to anyone, at least not anyone I know at this point.</p>
80104|interview|DVD at home|2001-10-14|<p>There are a handful of Korean films that I've read synopses or reviews for recently, and put them on my list of films to watch out for. Given that I'd already rented an action film, I wanted something to balance it out, and although I couldn't remember the specifics of the film, I remembered the title and that it was something of a romance. This is fortunate, because a lot of these films don't provide English-language synopses on their covers, only Korean.</p><p>This movie is very hard to follow at first, and although things begin to come together later in the film, you really cannot track what's going on when the movie starts. There is a movie within a movie, and the film crew is interviewing people about their ideas about love, and then following them through their experiences over a certain length of time. The director, Eunseok, is drawn to one of the interviewees, Yeongheui. The relationship between them, however, is never very clear, and even when the movie ends you don't have your typical romantic ending.</p><p>Although the film did get interesting once things fell together, I was hard-pressed to keep my attention at first. They really play with time, so that you see some scenes a couple times, and one scene you even see something like 5 or 6 times. You aren't always aware of what time scenes are taking place, since the movie only openly jumps back in time a couple times, to 1 year earlier when the director was in Paris and the flashback to the turning point in Yeongheui's life. The other times, you don't realize you have moved back in time until the scene catches up to something you've already seen. This is clearly an art film on this level, though I have to say it was well done, so that it was more interesting than annoying in the end.</p><p>The film was very moving for me near the end. I began to feel some of the sorrow of the main female, but I'm not sure this was a good thing. In the end, I felt depressed, and I still feel depressed thinking back on the movie. The movie also gets you to think about love and relationships, and I guess that makes the depression that much more poignant.</p><p>I'm not sure I would recommend this film. I am not sorry that I saw it, and I honestly think it was well put-together. I just don't know anyone who woul. enjoy the film... I don't like recommending depressing films to people, and particularly if they don't have an over-arching social message about the need to change things.</p>
80105|chinastrikeforce|DVD at home|2001-10-14|<p>I knew of this film when it was showing in Hong Kong at the top of the box office list. That'll typically be enough to get me to rent a film, and since I knew I could return the movie the following day (the latest releases have a shorter rental time, of course), I decided to grab it for one of my rare free Sundays.</p><p>Darren and Alex are rookies just out of training and thrown into the Shanghai streets. There, they soon get involved in a smuggling case after they witness the assassination of one of the local boss's men. At the scene of the crime, the seductive Norika grabs something from the pocket of the  dead man, and the suspicion heads her way first. Meanwhile, there is tension in the crime family, as young Tony comes in on Uncle Ma's bad side when he tried to get the family involved in drugs via the L.A. entrepreneur, Coolio.</p><p>This film doesn't pull you in with its plot. This isn't to say that it isn't interesting, but I just never felt anything for the main characters. There is, of course, one exception, which is Norika... but the feeling I got for her wasn't her character, but was simply a very strong desire to have sex. That woman was just too much, and they play it up the whole movie.</p><p>What the film lacks in plot, it makes up for in action. This is over-the-top Hong Kong action, which completely improbable scenes all the way up to the final fight scene, which probably drags on too long, but it quite impressive nonetheless. We've got a race between a Lamborghini and a formula-one racer, even. The fighting is pretty tight, and although it does use wire-work extensively at times, it isn't the far-flung wire-work of the period pieces.</p><p>I think most action fans would like this film. To boot, most of the film is actually in English. The dialogue isn't spectacular, but many of the actors are native or fluent speakers. If you want to see a movie just designed to wow you, or you are horny and want to be frustrated by one of the most attractive Japanese women of late, I definitely recommend checking out this film.</p>
80106|kippur|DVD at home|2001-10-20|<p>I had heard about this film when I was in France earlier in the year. I've never seen any Israeli films, or can even name any besides this one, so it isn't something I would have come across on my own. I was told that it was a very good film depicting the horrors of war without bullshit sentimentalism.</p><p>This is a long movie, and not simply in minutes, but the shots are slow and long, and you need to be awake when you start to watch this film. The movie is quite beautiful, really an art movie when it comes down to it. Essentially, two friends are called to active duty when the Yom Kippur War starts. They make their way to the front, and unable to meet up with their own unit, join with a helicopter rescue team.</p><p>This is not an uplifting movie by any means. The main character is already hesitant about putting his life on the line, and then he gets to witness the incredible misery of the injured and dead on the front line. Although the audience is not really shown any gore, you do see soldiers who have been burnt alive inside tanks. Although for me the emotion didn't come across as fully as I'm sure was intended, you do get some sense of the horrors that the survivors of wars must go through.</p><p>I most certainly would recommend this film to others, but you really need to be in the proper mood to watch it. It is a slow, visually intensive film that portrays the plight of those forced into war. The main failing of the film is that it doesn't explain the politics at all, so although from a human level you can be disturbed by war, you aren't shown the policies which serve other's interests and lead us into the wars to begin with.</p>
80107|rumble|DVD at home|2001-10-21|<p>I haven't seen this film in some time, and I think it is one of the few Jackie Chan films which I had only seen in its Americanized, English-dubbed version. I've now corrected that problem, catching this full-length, Chinese-language version. Because it's been so long since I saw this originally, I couldn't tell which 20 minutes or so were cut from the U.S. release.</p><p>Jackie comes to New York (actually Toronto, if I remember correctly) to help his uncle sell his business and get married. The store is in a \"bad\" part of town, and the uncle fails to tell anyone about the protection money that he regularly spends or the gangs which come to collect it. Besides getting involved in fighting the gang, Jackie gets romantic with Francoise's character, who is at least half his age but also a member of the biker gang terrorizing the neighborhood. On top of all this, some heavyweight diamond smugglers get involved in the act.</p><p>You don't watch this film for realism. The plot is patently absurd. The police do manage to show up every now and then, but never seem to be around for wealthy store-owners when they are needed. At least in <short=\"madmax\">Mad Max</a> there is a good reason why the cops cannot handle the outlaw bikers, but here we just have to understand that New York City has entire boroughs which are completely lawless. Then, of course, you have Jackie's amazing ability to play on the heartstrings of lumpen bikers so that they might turn over a new leaf and cease their harassment of the locals. It seems the film was over 10 years too late for the U.S., because it really has the cheesy feel of early-80s American films with their romantic portrayals of punk rockers.</p><p>Action, now that's why you watch this film. There are a number of really cool scenes, including the famous hovercraft finale. The most significant fight scene is when Jackie walks into the gang's lair and takes them all on. Most of the other fights are rather short, though with plenty of comedic elements. Overall, however, I have to say that this isn't the best of Jackie. The action isn't nearly as memorable as it needs to be to counter-balance the plot.</p><p>I'm a Jackie fan, so it is hard to not recommend even his worst 1970s films. This shouldn't be your first Jackie film, but once you have gotten through his best films, it is worth a watch.</p>
80108|attackthegasstation|DVD at home|2001-10-22|<p>I don't know much about Korean movies, but I figure if they make it far enough that they are put on DVD with English subtitles, then they are probably worth a look. I heard about this movie the same way I've heard of just about every other Korean film, I saw the DVD for sale on a web site or I saw it for rent at the video store (or both, actually). An action-comedy about disaffected youth. Count me in.</p><p>Four friends rob a gas station. Some time later (days? weeks?), they are bored and decide to go rob the same gas station. When they find very little money, they decide to take the attendants and owner hostage. After that, things get a little bizarre, although still touched with reality. They pump gas for customers, take more hostages as the situation demands, avoid the police... sorta, and take on various gangs as they come at them.</p><p>This movie is hilarious. I laughed a lot, and out loud. The four characters are all endearing, as are some of the hostages (the bullied kid and the very attractive attendant, in particular). At different points in the movie you get a short flashback as to how each of the four got to where they are, i.e. on the trashheap of society. I was rooting for them many times, especially against the owner who was very accurately portrayed (meaning, his petty, small-business owner mentality was right on the money).</p><p>There are many, many wonderful scenes which end up touching on a number of different subjects. One example is when they take an \"attractive\" woman hostage. She really thinks she's better than everyone else, but as one of the other hostages points out, her face is the result of plastic surgery and face lifts. The female attendant rightly draws attention to herself (and she is by far the more attractive of the two, physically and personality) to make light of what is considered \"beautiful.. Then, when the hostage calls one of our protagonists \"stupid,\" she is forced to play a rather interesting game (a word game which exists in Japanese and Korean, but doesn't make much sense in English, though they do a good job of translating it for the audience).</p><p>One thing about Korean transliteration: Yu Gee-Tae is also the lead actor from <short=\"ditto\">Ditto</a>, though you might have trouble figuring that out from they way they are written. The acting in the film is pretty good. Though I had a suspicion that some of the actors are probably Korean pop-stars in reality, they still did a good job. My only complaint on this level would be with the guy who is addicted to music, whose character wasn't very interesting to begin with, and just didn't come across as convincing as the other three.</p><p>I most certainly recommend this film to everyone. It was just too much fun and addressed a lot of little issues, even if somewhat indirectly. I really came away with the movie with a good feeling.</p>
80109|evolution|Airplane from Los Angeles to Houston|2001-10-24|<p>Some time back, while flying Continental, there was a serious delay and so I ended up getting some coupons for my trouble. Those coupons expire soon, so I decided that no matter what the movie was (well, not exactly), I was going to use my coupon for a free headset rental to watch it, since otherwise it would go to waste. I had heard of this movie when it was in the theaters, but it didn't really attract my attention. To be honest, I probably would have never seen it if it wasn't for this flight.</p><p>Basically, a meteorite strikes the Earth somewhere in Arizona, and a couple local scientists from the community college are able to get in there quickly to take samples. It turns out the rock carries some alien life form that can evolve at a very rapid pace. Quickly the government steps in, and when the problem jumps to a new level (i.e. the quick extinction of human beings in a manner of weeks), the army's answer will only make things worse.</p><p>The movie is funny, though most of the jokes are sexual or related to bodily functions. Not exactly high-brow humor, though there are some ideas that float around in the film that make you wonder how sophisticated the science behind it is. The actors take to their roles well, and I was pleased to see David Duchovny's performance.</p><p>On the level of recommendation, I cannot say I'd send this one anyone's way. It wasn't a bad movie to watch on a plane, but I cannot imagine renting it. Unless you have some fantasy or infatuation with someone in the film, it isn't worth watching.</p>
80110|shaolinsoccer|DVD at home|2001-11-02|<p>There used to be a weekly mailing from the Hong Kong movie database, which I guess is now defunct, but they would give the top 10 movies for the different east Asian film markets. I remember this movie being on the top of the list for a while. (Btw, if anyone knows of a good alternate source for this info, or what happened to hkmdb, please let me know.. Upon reading the description, I was convinced that the movie would be pretty funny, so I went ahead and bought it on DVD with my last order.</p><p>The Golden Leg, as he used to be known, is now a lame lackey to the current soccer kingpin, who runs the Evil team. After being turned out, and coming across a local Shaolin master, he puts together a team of Shaolin adepts. They are able to use their powerful kungfu to dominate the other teams, leading to a final confrontation with the Evil team at the national championship.</p><p>Three words to describe this film... \"over the top!. If you cannot go beyond realistic action comedies, then stay very far away from this one. Although the special effects show through a little bit too much at times, this movie is reliant on the amazing powers of kungfu, such as flying, power and incredibly super speed. There are many amazing and wonderful scenes here, and I was laughing the whole way through. Even when you've gotten used to the style of humor that's coming your way, you get unexpected jokes right at the end of the film.</p><p>I would recommend this film to anyone looking for some fun escapism. It isn't going to teach you anything about life or happiness, but you'll enjoy yourself thoroughly.</p>
80111|theone|Loews Theater in Marina Del Rey|2001-11-03|<p>Although the reviews that started coming out about this film were mostly negative, there were two factors that were going to get me to see it no matter what. One, it's a Jet Li film, and although I've been thoroughly disillusioned by the wushu that he does, he is still a pleasure to watch, and about the best thing you are going to get in the U.S. right now for impressive physical movement. The second thing... I heard that the two main characters (both played by Jet) used xingyi and bagua as their fighting arts. In all honesty, that last factor would pull me to the worst film.</p><p>Lawless, a rogue multiverse official, has managed to kill 123 of the 125 different versions of himself running around in all the known parallel universes. There is only one more to take out before he came become \"the one.\" That happens to be Gabriel Yulaw, a member of the Los Angeles Sheriff Department, who also is quite adept as bagua. The problem, besides having the multiverse agents tracking him down, is that as the number of you's in the multiverse decreases, the power of the remaining you's increases. So, when Lawless arrives to take on Yulaw, it isn't going to be so easy.</p><p>The special effects in this movie are quite amazing, and they are very well done. That is one of the two main reasons you watch this film, the other being to see Jet Li fight Jet Li. The fighting is quite fun, and we do get to see quite a bit of xingyi and bagua, though unfortunately the bagua Jet wins so we don't see enough of the xingyi for me to be truly happy. A warning should probably be sent out at this point, that although both martial arts are represented in the film, what Jet does in a fight shouldn't be seen as representative of those arts themselves. The final fight scene is still a great scene, and the others quite fun as well.</p><p>Perhaps the thing which I liked the most was actually the homage to the xingyi master, Guo Yun Shen. Guo spent several years in prison, only able to practice beng quan because of his manacles (or so the story goes), and in the scene where Lawless is captured and imprisoned for a while, he is doing beng quan in his cell. In some ways, the downfall of this character could be a reference as well, since Guo did manage to be put in his place after leaving prison because he relied too much on his supposed superiority.</p><p>There are certainly problems with the film. My main complaint being that it was just way too short. When it ended I immediately looked at my watch. It was only about 85 minutes long. There is, of course, not must plot or character development in a film of this nature, but then I guess you wouldn't go see it for that anyways. I found it funny that they repeatedly mentioned the number of \"people\" that Lawless had killed, but the number only included the other versions of himself, and none of the innocent bystandards who met their demise along the way.</p><p>If you are a Jet Li fan, a fan of martial arts films, or someone who has just waited too long to see xingyi or bagua used in a film, then you must see this movie. It isn't for everyone, but I enjoyed it.</p>
80112|amelie|Royal Theater in West Los Angeles|2001-11-05|<p>This movie was playing in theaters when I was in Paris in the spring. It kept catching my eye, probably because Audrey Tautou is so attractive. I asked some friends about it, and they told me they liked it, though it wasn't exactly a heavy or sophisticated film. If I could speak French, I may have saw it then, but now that it is playing in American theaters with subtitles, that was enough for me.</p><p>Amelie has had a very isolated childhood, and the first several minutes of the film detail what we need to know about that. The film largely takes place over a few days when Amelie is around 23 years old, following the death of Princess Di (which floats in the background of the film). After finding some trinkets left by a little boy nearly 50 years ago, she decides to track the guy down to see how he will feel when he gets the long-lost treasures back. Throughout the film, Amelie tries to make other people happy through various schemes, including her co-workers, neighbors and her father. Of course, the one person still not happy is Amelie.</p><p>The film style is very interesting, and I cannot think of anything to compare it to. The style adds to the humor. The film overall is humorous and touching, and you find yourself intrigued by the different characters. It is a feel-good film, which doesn't really try to convey any message in any direct, heavy-handed manner.</p><p>I would recommend this film to people who don't mind less serious films. It is fun in an artistic way, but the art doesn't dominate such that you lose track of the plot and flow itself. The characters are weird and quirky, but familiar enough to relate to.</p>
80113|wuyen|James Bridge Theater at UCLA|2001-11-11|<p>To be honest, I haven't seem much of Johnny To's work, maybe only one other film. UCLA held a retrospective, and simply because it's Hong Kong cinema, you know I'm gonna try to go. Unfortunately, I couldn't make the opening night or the showing of <strong>The Mission</strong>, which is considered by many to be his best film. But, when I read about this film, how it was a spoof on sword-fighting films of the 60s, I knew that I had to make the time to see it. I'd heard of it before, but hadn't really known enough.</p><p>The emperor (actually, given the historical setting, this is a misnomer), played by Anita, is out hunting and comes across a sword in a stone. As she tries to pull it out, this attracts the attention of the local bandit leader, Wu Yen - played by the beautiful Sammi. In the ensuing struggle, they both have their hands on the sword when it comes loose, freeing the fairy enchantress, played by Cecilia. Cecilia then decides that she must win the love of and marry either of the two. Before she can set this up, though, Wu Yen and the emperor are engaged. The enchantress, however, has placed a mark upon Wu Yen's face that causes Emperor Qi to think she is ugly, thus rejecting her. Wu Yen is, however, the best fighter and general in the land, and the emperor is continually turning to her to save \"his\" own butt.</p><p>There are so many jokes in this film. It is a very good parody of both the various period pieces and sword-fighting women films. There are also random jokes with no seeming base in the story, like when we suddenly are watching the Olympics. There are running jokes which stay funny throughout the film, like the court historian who reports on all the mistakes and problems that the emperor has.</p><p>For overall enjoyment, I do have a couple complaints. One is the length. The movie began to drag on, partly because it was repetitious in the back-and-forth between the three characters. It certainly could have been shorter and benefited from it. The other major complaint was the characters. While Sammi's Wu Yen is quite likable (and I personally find her to be the most attractive of the three), the emperor and the enchantress are both rather annoying and unlikable... and are meant to be so. The story wouldn't work without this, but you cannot really get behind any resolution to their tensions, because you don't want to see Wu Yen with either of these losers.</p><p>I would recommend this film to Hong Kong aficionados, particularly if you are familiar with the old kung fu and period films which it spoofs. For other people, I think it can be fun, but I wouldn't recommend it as a early film in someone's learning process of the greatness of Hong Kong cinema.</p>
80114|mementomori|DVD at home|2001-11-12|<p>As part of my budding interest in Korean film, I bought this film along with a couple others a while back. It was labeled as a horror film, and since I've not been into that genre much, and I thought my girlfriend would like it, I decided to purchase it. Last night, I finally got around to watching it.</p><p>A girl comes across a diary on her way to school. As she begins to read through it, she becomes more and more intrigued about the lesbian couple in the school who originally put it together. When one of the girls commits suicide by jumping from the roof, things begin to get weirder. By the end of the film, the girl who found the diary feels like she's about to go insane. You also begin to learn a little about the school, the teachers, and more.</p><p>The movie is interesting, but hard to follow at times. There are a number of girls thrown at you quickly, and it took me a while to sort out which ones I was supposed to be paying close attention to. There are also a number of flashbacks, and it is often difficult to tell right away that they are flashbacks. This is especially true after the one girl kills herself, because some of the other characters also think they see her in the here and now.</p><p>I don't know what else to say about this film. I wasn't impressed with it as a horror film, and can only see it being placed there because of some blatantly supernatural events that take place. Some of the scenes are disturbing, and you feel some empathy for the characters, but not so deeply.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Not because it was so bad, but simply because it just doesn't come forward enough on any level that I can relate to in order to say why someone should watch it. Hey, not all Korean films can be cool.</p>
80115|championsforever|Video at home|2001-11-13|<p>I had been meaning to pick up Muhammad Ali's autobiography some time ago, and with the advertisements going up now for the movie next month, I finally grabbed a copy from the library. While I was at another library last week, I saw that they have this video, which seemed to concentrate on footage of great boxing matches from about 1970 to 1980. I've been wanting to see Ali's fighting style, since I also heard comments a while back about how he was really the last to fight with such skill, and that all the heavyweights now are mostly brute strength.</p><p>This is a documentary, of course. Reggie Jackson interviews and narrates through the movie. The different heavyweight champions from the 70s are all sitting around, answering questions and making comments. Interspersed are not only clips from famous fights, but also clips that define the times, such as the Watts riots, Nixon's resignation, etc. Things run chronologically, starting with Muhammad Ali's winning of the gold medal at the 1960 Olympics and progressing from there, with each of the people interweaved through Ali's experience and career.</p><p>As a documentary, this was very good. You do get a good sampling of fighting styles, of the changing times, and of the individual boxers. Reggie does a decent job, and although some of his questions are inane and flat, many spark interesting comments and answers.</p><p>For me the amazing thing was precisely the factor that got me to borrow the video in the first place... Ali's fighting. You really can see a difference in the way he fights, even compared to the other boxers present. He uses a lot more skill, and his accuracy is amazing. Into rounds 14 and 15, he is landing blows clean and direct, where many of the other boxers are sloppy in their throws, flailing with power, but still not targeting the way Ali does.</p><p>Also enjoyable is Ali's personality. This documentary is over 10 years old and Ali's disease (Parkinsons, I believe) is not very advanced, though it is noticeable in his speech. He is still very much committed to his beliefs and at the same time very charismatic. None of the other boxers are nearly as intelligent or likeable. Some, like Frazier, have clearly taken way too many blows to the head.</p><p>I'd recommend this to anyone, particularly if you don't know much about boxing (as I don't). I could see the distinction between boxers and begin to understand the skill involved in the sport. Although I have to read the book first, I will very likely be seeing the movie of Ali's life when it comes out next month.</p>
80116|runningoutoftime|James Bridge Theater at UCLA|2001-11-15|<p>The nice thing about these series at UCLA is that they are usually double features. Of course, you have to be able to sit in a seat for that long (there is a 15 minute break), but the price is right. Again, I didn't really read up on this film before attending, but I wasn't concerned about running into a horribly bad film... you have to rent those, usually.</p><p>Peter doesn't have very long to live, with terminal cancer that is causing internal bleeding. After shelling out the money for enough pain-killers to make it through the end, he sets about going out with a bang... we just don't know what kind of bang. Inspector Ho is an excellent cop, negotiating hostage situations and quickly putting two-and-two together to see why things happened the way they did. Peter puts him to the test when he \"robs\" a finance office.</p><p>This was an amazing movie that I would certainly watch again. You have a sense from the beginning that Peter is a good guy, but you really don't know what he's crafting until the end. Then there is the relationship between him and Ho, which is just excellently crafted. Both characters are very likable. The power of this film is really how crafty it is. This applies on many levels, from plot to action to different sequences.</p><p>I'm not sure what else to say about this film except \"see it.. I enjoyed it, and would willingly watch it again sometime. I cannot think of any reason why someone wouldn't like this film.</p>
80117|heroneverdies|James Bridge Theater at UCLA|2001-11-15|<p>Ahh, more Hong Kong cinema on the big screen. Just was the world needs more of. I didn't really know anything about this film before hand. I must have read the review and summary, but I didn't even remember them going in.</p><p>Jack and Martin are the right-hand men of the two crime bosses of Hong Kong. They are also friends. Needless to say, their paths are doomed to cross in the most unfortunate of ways, and in the end are required by their jobs to take each other out. Things don't always work like that on the big screen, though, and they both miraculously survive the bloodbath which kills everyone but the bosses themselves. And this is what brings them together in the end.</p><p>There are some wonderful scenes in this movie. The sunset scene in Thailand is just done very well on an emotional level. The killer scenes, however, are the action ones. My favorite isn't the finale, which is all too expected, but the last scene in Bangkok before Jack returns to Hong Kong. One shot even gives you a barrel-eye's view before snuffing a would-be assassin.</p><p>This movie also tries to provide a story of loyalty and friendship, but you should only watch it for the action. The story wasn't horrible, it just wasn't believable. It isn't so bad that you moan from the sappiness, but it comes as close as it can to that point. The four characters (including the pair of girlfriends) are just too tragic.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film. Not because it wasn't fun, and I don't regret having sat through it. I just don't think the story is worth the  watch.</p>
80118|audition|Nuart Theatre|2001-11-19|<p>I haven't seen too many modern Japanese films, but they always grab my attention when I see that one is playing around town. This one looked particularly interesting, probably in large part to the amount of buzz which it created. Billed as something of a horror, but certainly psychological, it looked promising. So, I headed to the theater with a couple friends to check it out, fearing that they might regret joining me.</p><p>As the film starts, we see Aoyama at his dying wife's side, as their young son approaches from down the hallway of the hospital. We then fast forward to seven years later. The son is high-school age, and Aoyama shows no signs of having been involved with anyone since his wife died. After his son suggests that he get remarried, a friend of his concocts the idea of holding auditions for a movie as a way of meeting the perfect woman. That's how Aoyama meets Asami. Despite warnings from his friend, the relationship between the two accelerate, until the point that she disappears after their first night of love-making. What he begins to uncover then, disturbs him... and by the end of the movie, you will be disturbed as well with the outcome.</p><p>This film pulls no punches, and you need to be prepared for some very graphic gore if you intend to sit through to the end. Most of it is at the very end of the movie. The first half of the movie really doesn't foreshadow very much what is to come. You are obviously suspicious, but don't know what to expect.</p><p>I have to say, after careful consideration, that I really liked this film. It was very hard to evaluate it at first, because it is quite disturbing on a few different levels. You begin the movie with a real affection for Aoyama. He seems like an alright guy who loved his wife and really takes care of his kid. The scheme to find a new wife makes you question him a bit, but he is still a likeable character. You get the sense that Asami is not normal, so you don't build up the same sympathy for her. But, by the end of the film, these roles get reversed as much as they possibly can.</p><p>The acting in this film is very good, and I just loved Shiina Eihi. I don't mean that I found her attractive, although she isn't bad looking. I just loved her character in the end, and loved how well she played it. The looks on her face near the end of the film really drive the movie. One of my friends could say to me later that night that, \"she rocked.. I concur.</p><p>I've already given my disclaimer, so with that said, this movie is worth watching. It may disturb you. If you are male, it might make you afraid. But if you like good cinema, you should watch it. It is a very well crafted film. Oh, and pay attention to the theme song at the end, which is mostly in English... it caps everything off perfectly.</p>
80119|highfidelity|DVD at home|2001-11-21|<p>I saw this some time ago (at least a year ago, since I don't have it listed yet). It changed my life. That may sound very odd, especially for a movie which doesn't try to be artsy, but the movie helped me realize things about myself. After telling my friend about the film and how much I liked it, I decided to just out a buy it. It wasn't until after this viewing that I realized how much it had changed me.</p><p>Rob Gordon has just been dumped. Rob owns a record shop, and his expression comes out through music and making top-five lists on a regular basis. Upon being dumped, he begins recounting to us the five worst break-ups of his life. Through it all, we see the kinds of relationships he has had as he begins to question \"the meaning of it all,\" as one ex-lover so aptly puts it.</p><p>This movie is one of the top-five greatest movies I have ever seen. It is a romantic comedy from the perspective of the guy. I'm not sure how women would like this film, but I think any guy who hasn't already achieved some sort of perfection in their personal life would gain something from watching this film. For that reason, I think women should see the film as well, because I really think Rob Gordon typifies many features that this society tends to infuse into our personalities. It is also quite funny. There are many great lines, and the two employees of Championship Vinyl are wonderful.</p><p>I don't know what else to say without going into my personal experiences. The film made me cry the first time I saw it (I was alone then), and even with someone else in the room this time, I cried even more. So many of the lines, and in particular the pivotal climax scene in the bar where he realizes the difference between Laura and other women, just hit too close to home for me not to cry.</p><p>I recommend this film to anyone. I know there are people who are going to be unimpressed or unappreciate it, but I know that any person who I can relate to is going to enjoy the film. As an additional bonus, the film takes place  in Chicago and there is even an <a href=\"http://www.apocalypsehoboken.com/\" title=\"Apocalypse Hoboken\">Apocalypse Hoboken</a> sticker if you watch for it in the record shop.</p>
80120|prodigalson|DVD at home|2001-11-22|<p>This is one of those movies you cannot help but notice the name of if you are at all into kung fu movies. I've seen it in a number of contexts, from Sammo Hung searches to just plain-old quality martial art film must-see lists. Sight unseen, I bought the DVD a while back, and finally got around to watching it, since I was sitting home alone with nothing to do anyway.</p><p>Young Leung has been learning kung fu, but his parents, hoping to shield their son from harm, have managed to pay off everyone so that they lose. The result, his kung fu is sub-par and not up to snuff for any real fight. He learns this the hard way, when he steps in for a friend beaten by a opera actor passing through town. He then takes the steps necessary to learn Wing Chun from the opera player, but is rejected as a student. He sticks with the master, however, through thick-and-thin, including the slaughter of the entire opera troupe at the hands of another prodigal son (though not with his knowledge).</p><p>The plot here is actually a bit new. Not that it ventures far from the  limitations of period-piece kung fu films, but it isn't bad. Nothing to really amaze the viewer, but enjoyable. The characters are also enjoyable and well-developed, so that you can understand and believe their motivation. There are some nice comedic elements courtesy of Sammo.</p><p>The fighting in the film is a lot of fun to watch. It really showcases several styles (although I'm personally unfamiliar with the styles in real life, unfortunately). Some things are thrown in which are likely part of the cinematic tradition, but most of the fighting is old-school solid. What I mean here is that the techniques are clear and the pace is fast enough to add the element of realism.</p><p>I would recommend this film to kung fu fans. I'd like to get an opinion someday from someone who has practiced Wing Chun, but the impression I get around the net is that it is fairly loyal. I don't regret this purchase, and would enjoy watching it on a lazy Saturday afternoon somewhere down the line.</p>
80121|boxingsbest|Video at home|2001-11-22|<p>I requested this from the library a while back, when I was looking for Ali's autobiography and came across it. This was put out by HBO and Sports Illustrated, and I assume it originally aired there. It is a documentary, if that wasn't already obvious.</p><p>Unlike the other <short=\"championsforever\">video</a> I watched recently, this one is entirely about Muhammad Ali. It runs from a quaint story of how he got into boxing in the first place and through to his defeat by Holmes. You get to see quite a bit of fight footage, intermixed with interviews from the archives and some conversation between the host and one of Ali's trainers.</p><p>If what you want to see is some excellent fight footage, this is a pretty good video to get hold of. It goes into some details of Ali's life, but to be honest it wasn't that great on these details. Some aspects of this video were better than the aforementioned video, but other aspects didn't come close (and the other one wasn't strictly about Ali). Another disappointment was that they didn't bother to talk to Ali today, which struck me as quite odd.</p><p>This is for boxing and Ali fans only. If you have an interested in either of these two subject matters, it is worth checking the hour-long documentary out. Otherwise, there are probably better resources for this information.</p>
80122|indecentproposal|Video at home|2001-11-24|<p>I'll admit, when I first heard about this movie, I never thought I would see it. The whole idea of the film just seemed messed up, and clearly about people who I have no relation to whatsoever. When my friend explained to me that she thought it was a very good movie and that we should see it, I had to have it explained to me. With some encouragement, we watched it the other night, since I trust her opinions in movies, even if they aren't always the same as mine.</p><p>David and Diana are very, very happy together (and wouldn't you be if you were having sex with Demi Moore!), but they are having financial troubles. In a moment of inspiration, they decide to head to Vegas to try to win some money to begin paying off their debts. Things go well at first, but then they bet the farm and lose. Enter billionaire John Gage, who is willing to pay $1 million to sleep with Diana for one night. As much as they think this will be something they can put behind them and live happily ever after, we see that things turn out differently.</p><p>OK, so why was I sceptical about seeing this film to begin with. The above description should be enough. First off, I have no desire to ever set foot in the city of Las Vegas. Second, how can I related to a couple of people who are able to get themselves that far in debt. Third, I hate gambling and therefore cannot relate to someone who bets over $4000 in one shot. Fourth, how can a guy who is willing to pay a million bucks to sleep with your wife and run you through psychological hell be at all admirable. And in the end, I was still right on a lot of these points.</p><p>It's the movie in its details and in the abstract that are touching, that make this a great film to watch. First off, why is Diana motivated to sleep with the billionaire. Because she wants to do it for her husband. That sounds a bit hard to swallow, I know (which is where the subject matter and plot fails, to be honest), but as an abstract notion of sacrifice purely to make another person happy it works. There are several other good ideas in the film, that are easy to stumble on because of the plot itself. For example, true love is not about forgetting the past, but about forgiving and creating an open dialogue that allows you to grow together. The mistake they make is thinking that they don't need to discuss it, that they can just forget it ever happened. I've learned the hard way that understanding can only come through discussion.</p><p>Yeah, this movie isn't for everyone. If you don't like romances, you should steer clear, for obvious reasons. But, even if you do like romances, I think that you have to be able to look beyond the quite lame concept of the plot to see where this movie shines through. I'm glad that I have seen it.</p>
80123|godofcookery|DVD at home|2001-11-24|<p>I'd heard some time ago that Stephen Chow was the king of Hong Kong comedy, and after seeing <short=\"shaolinsoccer\">Shaolin Soccer</a> I was certainly up for seeing more of his stuff. I'd heard of this movie a while back, but it us usually quite hard to make the call as to which movie I want to see when I'm in the video store. There are a couple more of his movies on my list, so expect to see him again.</p><p>Stephen Chow is the god of cookery, and he makes sure everyone knows it. Early on we see him judging a competition among supposedly top chefs in Hong Kong, only to give them all failing marks for various pretentious reasons. But being at the top, there is room to fall, and soon he is toppled by a new chef who appears to have talent where Stephen does not. To boot, he is involved in a scandal serving British beef to customers (cannot remember now if it is mad-cow or foot-and-mouth that it is supposed to be contaminated with). Down and out on Temple Street, he hooks up with street vendors to create a new food sensation (\"Pissing Beef Balls\"), and in turn vie once again for the title of god of cookery.</p><p>This is Hong Kong absurd comedy at some of its best. The film is also well embedded in cinema, making clear references to the Japanese TV show, <strong>Iron Chef</strong> (note, this is before anyone in the U.S. knew much about it), as well as the classic food comedy <strong>Tampopo</strong>. There are also numerous references to Hong Kong films, as well as wonderful plays upon all sorts of kung fu films and the genre in general. Luckily the person I was watching the film with remembered <strong>Tampopo</strong> better than I did, because I would have missed several (though not all) of these homages.</p><p>Hong Kong's comedy of the absurd is not for everyone. I've somehow taken a liking to it, but I know some people just cannot get into it (and it isn't merely a cultural think). If you haven't seen any, this is a good film to get a taste of it (no pun intended). It is quite funny without understanding the cinematic context it is floating in. Chow is quite competent at putting these movies together, so you could do much, much worse. Check the film out if you can get your hands on it.</p>
80124|billyelliot|DVD at home|2001-12-03|<p>This is one of those movies I wanted to see in the theaters, but just never got a chance. And then when it came out on video, I just kept forgetting that it was there, or I already had something else in mind when I went to the store. Looking for a drama last night, this came up, finally.</p><p>Billy's mother died recently from some kind of terminal illness and his family is facing additional hard times because the 1984 miners' strike is on (they're miners, of course). Distracted from his boxing lessons, Billy stumbles on a ballet class and participates. He enjoys it and continues, in secret because he is afraid of letting his father or friends know. Billy also appears to have some innate talent, and in the end, money must be found for Billy to travel to London for an audition with the Royal School of Ballet.</p><p>This is a feel-good movie, in the end. There are plenty of funny parts, and the story is a touching one, though I have to admit it didn't hit me as deeply as it could have. It was nice to see the strike material thrown in, though I was left wondering how realistic some scenes were (the million cops chasing after one guy). The movie doesn't deal so closely with the strike, but it does play an important role in the film. The kid who plays Billy is quite talented, and it was enjoyable to watch him dance though at times the feel of the movie moved more into the realm of fantastic musical rather than realistic dancing.</p><p>I recommend this film. It isn't the greatest film, and I wouldn't place it as high as many people did for the year, but it is still a very good film worth watching.</p>
80125|metadefumaca|DVD at home|2001-12-04|<p>I heard of this movie quite some time ago. Part of what kept me from renting if before now was the fact that it was still in the new release section of the store, and since those have to be back the next day, they aren't usually so inviting to overcome the inconvenience. It's on regular 6-day rental now, so I grabbed it last night and watched it with my roommates.</p><p>Roy returns from Brazil after many, many years to Hong Kong. He soon enlists the help of Smokey to find an old rival who stole his girl and sent him off to Brazil in the first place. They begin the search, encountering many different elements of the Hong Kong underworld, particularly the not so glamorous ones that you usually don't see in triad films. As things progress, you realize that memory is an issue, and that Roy is quickly loosing much of his at the same time that Smokey and his mother are trying to cultivate theirs.</p><p>This is a good movie. It is a drama about a man loosing his memory and simply trying to hold onto the good ones he has. There are many funny parts, but as a whole the story is simply touching. I enjoyed it more because I didn't know what Roy's problem was... though the clues were nicely laid so that I was pretty sure about what was up once things started rolling. Smokey is an interesting character as well, and he balances well against Roy.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to everyone. The dialogue might run by a little quickly if you aren't used to subtitles, but the plot is interesting and you won't be disappointed with the ending.</p>
80126|wickedcity|Video at home|2001-12-07|<p>I really found out about this movie through a movie review I came across on the web. I had already seen the <short=\"wickedcityanime\">anime</a> version of the story, but this was supposed to be different. Because my friend is trying to do some research specifically on supernatural films from Hong Kong, I thought it'd be worth a try.</p><p>Giving a plot summary of this film is difficult. It starts off like the anime version, but then returns to Hong Kong from Japan. Taki is to look into a rapter boss who is quite old and in possession of a nice chunk of the economy. Along the way, his partner is reveals to be the child of a rapter and a human love affair. To boot, Taki has been in such a relationship himself, though as of yet there are no offspring. The child of our old rapter is poised to take over the empire and destroy humanity at the same time with a rapter drug that evaporates you if you stop taking it.</p><p>Compared to the anime, this is much more tame. There isn't explicit sex, but then you cannot get away with that kind of thing on film in Hong Kong the way you can with cartoons in Japan. The plot is comprehensible, but that's as much as I can really say. There's a logic tying things together, but you as the view just have a hard time buying any of it. So much is outright confusing, and the action just doesn't do anything for me. I had heard about the airplane battle at the end, and that was even disappointing, since I had something much bigger in mind.</p><p>I see no reason for anyone to watch this film. Tsui Hark wrote it, but that doesn't mean squat. Save your time and money on this one.</p>
80127|prettyinpink|Video at home|2001-12-08|<p>I simply assumed that I had seen this movie as a kid. I'm quite familiar  with the famous \"If You Leave\" song at the end of the film and knew it was associated with this film, but I guess my enjoyment of that song simply came from the radio. I quickly realized I hadn't seen this before, and here I had suggested to my wife that we watch it so that she could see some of the movies that my generation of Americans grew up on.</p><p>Andie is about to finish high school and is confronting issues like love and the prom. Her father is still obsessed with the wife who left them both about three years earlier. Her best friend, Ducky, is \"secretly\" in love with her but can never work up the courage to say it. Out of nowhere, a preppie catches her eye, and she has to deal with the issue of being in love with someone from the better side of the tracks. They quickly learn that their friends aren't all that supportive.</p><p>Part of the difficulty of watching this film now is getting beyond the fashion. Everyone in high school is fashion-conscious to an extent that I cannot remember. I guess I was just so far from any crowd which cared that I missed it. School here is clearly divided into the poor kids who dress new wave and the rich kids who dress as rich kids always do.</p><p>The plot here is pretty basic, though I have to say that things don't get resolved quite in the time sequence that I would expect. You get the happy ending which you are expecting from a high school film. That actually disappointed me. Not because Molly's character ended up with the guy of her dreams, but because Ducky gets pawned off so easily. You just don't drop an obsession like that at the drop of the hat. You can be civil about it, the way that he finally is, but I think the film would have been a little better if they had just left that unanswered.</p><p>I really cannot recommend this film now. Molly really only made three movies (that anyone's heard of at least), so unless you are into some odd retrospective of her 15-minutes, there isn't anything here that is going to  impress after 15 years. My roommate owned the movie, so I didn't have that much to lose.</p>
80128|gojira|Japan American Theater in Little Tokyo|2001-12-09|<p>I wasn't sure if I'd ever actually seen this film, and if I had, it had certainly been too long ago for me to remember. I know that I saw the chopped-up U.S. version of the film with Raymond Burr spliced in, but I had no interest in watching that again. I have a Master's degree in Japanese history, so I know a lot about this film in its historical context. I've actually been waiting for something like a DVD release of the original Japanese with subtitles, but when I heard that they were going to play it on the big screen downtown, I couldn't pass up the opportunity.</p><p>A fishing boat off of Oda island sends in an S.O.S. report after they are hit with what looks like a nuclear blast. The rescue ship disappears as do a number of other ships shortly thereafter. The three survivors tell stories that don't make sense. A trip to the island reveals that the islanders have old tales of a sea monster known as Gojira (Godzilla in English) who would come ashore when the fishing was sparse. A scientific inquiry is launched, revealing seriously high levels of radioactivity, a trilobite, and the first  encounter with the king of monsters. Attention then turns to Tokyo, which is soon to become the next victim of Gojira's wrath.</p><p>This film is not only a classic because it spawned a monster movie industry that seriously influenced my childhood. This is one of the most political science fiction movies I can name. I'm not sure how aware of this people outside of my former discipline are (or even within it), because the original version of this film which contains most of the hard-core aspect of the message is not widely available (if at all, I haven't found it!). Although many things are not subtle, some of the symbols and meaning can be missed by those who have never studied war-time and post-war Japan.</p><p>This film was released when the events following the U.S. H-bomb test at  Bikini Atoll were fresh in everyone's mind. A Japanese fishing boat was in caught in the explosion, and although the fishermen returned to Japan alive, they all died shortly thereafter of radiation sicknesses. That it is fishermen who first meet their demise from the radioactive fire of Gojira's breath would not have been missed by any Japanese viewing in 1954.</p><p>For the most part, Gojira is the United States. He is this horrible, pre-historic, un-civilized monster that just comes in and destroys. He is brought to life (or awaken, technically) through the testing of the H-bomb. The damage he does mirrors that of the fire-bombing of Tokyo. Although it has also been explained to me that the first building Gojira destroys in Tokyo is actually the U.S. Embassy, I could not tell from watching the film. But this would make sense. It would be symbolic of the cutting of ties as the first step in the mass murder.</p><p>The connection with the fire-bombing of Tokyo and the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are quite clear. A scene on a train has a few people talking about it (this is unrealisting, though, because everyone knows that Japanese don't talk when they are on the train ...). One woman reveals that she lived through Nagasaki and that she is afraid of what is going to happen now, doesn't know if she can handle it. A man mentions that he does not want to have to evacuate Tokyo, AGAIN. Except for pre-teens, everyone watching this film, particularly in any of the three aforementioned cities, would have understood this. The fire-bombing of Tokyo killed more people than the atomic bombs did. These kinds of scenes brought me to the edge of tears because I could understand the kind of pain, and how realistic this film could have felt for someone watching it then. The scenes of Tokyo the day after Gojira has come through could have been taken from file footage of Tokyo in 1945 or Hiroshima and Nagasaki in late August 1945... the complete and utter destruction looked to be straight from photos I have seen.</p><p>The overwhelming message of this film is against \"weapons of mass destruction.. The obvious culprits are nuclear weapons, both the A-bomb and the newly tested H-bomb. But the plot also makes it clear that it isn't just these two technologies which are a threat, because in order to destroy Gojira, a scientist comes forth with an even more destructive technology. Unwilling to unleash the technology because of his fears, he had kept the discovery secret. When he is finally convinced that it must be used in order to stop the killing of innocent people throughout Tokyo and Japan, he has enough forethought to destroy all of his research. Furthermore, he destroys himself so to completely prevent the technology from ever being pried from his head. The final lines of the film drive the problem home: as long as anyone (and in particular the U.S.?) is creating, testing, using or maintaining such weapons, the destruction that Gojira wreaks will always reoccur... there will be more Gojiras.</p><p>This film could not have been made by anybody but the Japanese. Japan is the home to some of the strongest anti-nuclear movements ever (for obvious reasons), and this film draws on that tradition. Obviously, this film was not made to be an even-handed portrayal of weapons of mass destruction, but it isn't dogmatic at the same time. In a larger context, problems can be found with the film, but you really move into nit-picking at that point.</p><p>If you can get your hands on a subtitled version of this film, you MUST see it. It isn't the greatest film ever made, but it is a must-see for anyone who is at all serious about film. This isn't a cheesey sci-fi flick meant only for kids and dorks, this is a film which everyone should see.</p>
80129|feel100|Video at home|2001-12-10|<p>I had heard of this film some time ago, but honestly didn't know anything about it. I still didn't know anything about it when I rented it, but had a sense that it would be something of a drama / comedy / romance kind of joint, so would fit the mood I was in. I didn't even realize who was in it until I started watching it.</p><p>This is the story of three friends, two guys and a woman. I think we are meant to believe that they are all just out of high school, but this wasn't clear to me. It appears to be based upon a comic book, and maybe there is more information there. In any case, the guys quickly find women to fill their lives, but the woman is still alone. As situations change, we will find out who means what to whom.</p><p>It was difficult to follow this movie at times. One major problem was the subtitling, which was white text over a white background all too often. Since this is a dialogue heavy film, things are bound to suffer because of it. I actually dozed off a couple times during the film and had to rewind because I just wasn't involved with what was going on.</p><p>On the positive side, there are some genuinely funny moments in this film. I would call it a light romance, since the issues never seemed to get too heavy or philosophical for me. In addition, I just have a thing for Sammi Cheng. I never saw her in a film until <short=\"wuyen\">recently</a>, but there is just something about the way she looks and her style, not to mention her voice.</p><p>At this point I cannot recommend this film. I guess if you are really into the genre is touches on, you'll like it, but otherwise it isn't going to inspire you at all. I have the video for a couple more days, so I might try to watch the second half again and reevaluate things, but until then...</p>
80130|conan|DVD at home|2001-12-11|<p>I think I've made my position on this movie somewhat clear in previous reviews. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, at least for the genre, but even overall. I already owned the movie on video and then bought it on DVD a little over a year ago. I watched it a couple times right away, once to hear the commentary track which is quite funny. Since my roommate hadn't seen the film, I wasn't going to object to watching it last night.</p><p>Young Conan sees his family and people slaughtered and then is dragged off into slavery. After developing into an incredibly strong man, his master throws him into pit-fighting. Excelling at this, he travels far and wide until the day he is mysteriously set free. Left on his own, he decides to track down the people who killed his family, a snake cult headed by Thulsa Doom, which has come to dominate the countryside. With the help of a few friends, he is enlisted to infiltrate the cult's Mountain of Power.</p><p>For anyone who has even an inkling of flavor for the fantasy genre, this is THE film. There really are few which even come close to touching it. The plot is not extraordinary, but it is done believably. You don't feel like you are watching some geek dream, but that you have stepped into an actual world. This is probably due to the fact that Conan has a long history behind him. Unfortunately, I am not up on that, not have read any of the novels or any of the comic books. The production values here are high, unlike most films with such a subject matter.</p><p>There are many wonderful lines in this film. Conan's paraphrase of the Ghengis Khan quote is wonderful, but then Thulsa Doom's demonstration of what is power is one of the best. It makes the film well-rounded, with comedy and politics and love. You feel sorry for the camel, but it is still funny to see.</p><p>This film isn't just for fans of the fantasy genre. I think everyone should see this film. If you don't like it, then stop reading my movie reviews because we clearly have nothing in common.</p>
80131|flyingguillotine|Video at home|2001-12-12|<p>I feel there is a fundamental part of potential childhood that I just missed out on. I saw the Saturday afternoon kung fu movies every now and then, but it still wasn't all that often and not really memorable. Maybe I'm just a tad too young. In any case, there are all these movies which I feel I should have  watched ages ago but haven't yet seen. Everyone knows about the flying guillotine, but until last night, I'd never seen it.</p><p>Ching officials die tracking down rebels and send off a message to their blind brother that they have been killed by a one-armed man. Our old blind master, along with being a right \"bastard,\" is a master of the flying guillotine. Our hero, the one armed boxer runs a school. Word comes of a tournament, and although the one armed boxer does not wish to participate, everyone knows that he is expected to show.</p><p>Much of this film is straight cheese, but then you don't watch these kinds of film if you don't expect a healthy dose of that already. For the most part, there are just numerous excuses to fight, and the tournament which takes up an incredible chunk of the movie doesn't even depict the protagonist fighting but just seems like an excuse to put a bunch of different styles on film.</p><p>That said, the film is a lot of fun. There are a number of different tricks and weapons pulled out that are interesting. The Thai fighter is pretty cool, and even if it is an Chinese guy with make-up on, his movement is nice even if his technique is simple. My absolute favorite, however, is the Yoga master (again, Chinese guy made to look like an Indian). I'm not sure where the idea comes from originally, since I haven't seen any of the other Yoga martial art films, but the guy has arms which extend at will. If you've ever played the video game <strong>Street Fighter 2</strong>, it's the same trick that Dhalsim does many years later. For 1975, it is done very well, and the fights he has play our pretty well.</p><p>This is definitely a movie to see if you are into Seventies kung fu movies. Other people might enjoy it, but they probably aren't going to pick it up without this first incentive. I enjoyed it and would have to stop and watch it if even I was channel surfing on a Saturday afternoon and caught a glimpse.</p>
80132|robocop|DVD at home|2001-12-16|<p>There are a few different versions of this film out on DVD now, but I managed to buy a <a href=\"http://www.criterionco.com/\" title=\"Criterion Collection\">Criterion</a> edition of it before they disappeared. Now, I realize that it went out of print because someone else must have bought up the rights, and recently released the film again. Nobody does better than Criterion, so I'm pleased. Finally got around to watching it, though I've still got to get through all of the commentary track.</p><p>In the future, Detroit is dominated by a company known as Omni Consumer Products. They recently entered into a contract to run the police department. In search of \"solutions,\" they experiment with robotic police officers. After the first one fails, a young executive comes in with his plan to use a deceased officer's mind and body as part of a cyborg. The result is Robocop. But what does this mean for crime in Detroit, for the \"deceased\" officer, and the nature of law enforcement in a society run by corporations.</p><p>This is what science fiction is supposed to be. For the uninterested, it is still entertaining. But for anyone with a head on their shoulders, there is a ton of commentary on society, politics and the economy. In one of his comments, the director calls this film \"fascism for liberals,\" and I think that is an apt statement. I may quibble about the exact meaning of the word fascism, but the point is well understood, in that many of the things in the movie are the natural conclusions of the current development of society should things not be checked. It is how we can get a totalitarian state with the full backing of politicians without any kind of coup d'etat.</p><p>On top of all this, this is just a cool movie. There are many funny parts, in particular the news and commercial breaks. The visuals of the film are quite beautiful. And Weller does a wonderful job of portraying the protagonist.</p><p>I bought this DVD for a reason: because I honestly feel it is one of the great films out there. I recommend it for everyone. Be careful, the uncut DVD is a bit more gorey, but otherwise there are no reservations.</p>
80133|moonovertao|Video at home|2001-12-16|<p>Last week I was looking for some movie information on the web and came across a review of another movie by Amamiya. In the review, this film was mentioned as a better option for the genre. My interest piqued, I looked for it at the video store and lo-and-behold they had it.</p><p>Suikyo, a priest, and Hayate, the best swordsman of some lord, set out in search of the origin of a particular sword, which can cut through stone and heals itself of all knicks. They seek out Kakugyo, another priest who uses his magic powers for evil. Along the way, they run into Renge, a young girl (about 15) who makes her living gathering honey in a bandit-infested forest. In come the aliens Marien, Abira and Kuzto, all played by the gorgeous Moriyama Yuko. Turns out, the core of the meteor that Kakugyo used to make these amazing swords is actually a dormant weapon, known as the Makaraga.</p><p>This is a great mix of sci-fi and fantasy. It takes place in feudal Japan. There are many things in this film which were completely new to me, but I  was certainly pleased to see. I felt somewhat inspired to go out and write a new role-playing character based on Suikyo. This priest casts spells by writing them, often on a little notepad he keeps on his belt. Furthermore, I was pleasantly surprised to see the weapon he pulled out... and jumbo-sized writing brush.</p><p>The fight scenes are pretty well done, although I don't have the experience to say whether or not they were legitimate, it was always nice to watch. And the Makaraga is just plain awesome. They definitely put the money into making this monster look good, and although it doesn't come across as natural (meaning as a sustainable life force), it does look vicious. A last tip of the hat goes to Moriyama Yuko, who in addition to being beautiful did an excellent job of conveying the different characters without saying a thing.</p><p>Obviously, this film isn't for everyone, but I definitely recommend it to anyone who might be interested in the genre. There is great combat and fresh ideas, and that's enough for me.</p>
80134|moonwarriors|Video at home|2001-12-17|<p>I heard of this movie through a few different sources, in particular web sites talking about wuxia films. The straw that broke the camel's back, though, was an article in <a href=\"http://www.wizards.com/dragon/\" title=\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\">Dragon Magazine</a> that listed the film. It wasn't a rave review, but it did list it, so I figured that was enough to check it out.</p><p>It is sad, but I'm already having trouble remembering how this film went. The deposed emperor is running for his life when a peasant cutting bamboo helps save his life. The peasant, not realizing who he is dealing with, hides the guy and his entourage from the pursuit of the evil brother who is now emperor. Somewhere down the line, the peasant is enlisted to bring the good emperor's fiance back, and in the process they fall in love. Also thrown in there is a killer whale that the peasant likes to play with. With these elements, you should guess where the climax is heading.</p><p>I have to admit, part of the reason I cannot remember the plot is because I dozed off a couple times. This should reflect upon the movie. The fight scenes are quite good (Sammo tends to do an excellent job) and there are some nice surprises, like the killer whale getting involved. The movie is fairly somber, and for me the characters were not all that involving, so that I couldn't care one way or another how things turned out.</p><p>This is a fairly ho-hum wuxia flick. The fighting is excellent, but I don't think it is enough to recommend the film on. The novelty of this film is really the killer whale, and the credits roll over footage of Andy Lau playing with the animal. It's not worth picking up, though I cannot say it was horrible.</p>
80135|fellowship|The Bridge, Howard Hughes Plaza|2001-12-19|<p>There was no question that I would see this film, and little question that I would see it on opening day. Neither did I shrink back from paying $13 a ticket to see it in what is supposed to be the most luxurious theater around. Although I did read Tolkien's books rather late in life, too much of my activities (read: D&amp;D) have been influenced by this work not to finally read them over the last few years (before I knew they were making the film, though that certainly gave me reason to rush). And then to find out that Peter Jackson was directing brought up my hopes, since he has done some wonderful movies to date.</p><p>Upon retirement, Bilbo Baggins reluctantly leaves his ring to his nephew, Frodo. Frodo quickly finds out that the ring is actually the One Ring, and that the dark lord is out to recover it. Frodo, together with his friend, Samwise, leave the Shire just as the ring wraiths are closing in for the kill. A few narrow brushes with death later, Frodo, Sam, a couple more hobbits, and Strider (Aragorn) are in Rivendell, and it is decided that the ring must be returned to Mordor and cast into the fire which forged it. Accompanying them are Legolas (an elf), Gimli (a dwarf), Boromir (a human) and Gandalf the Gray. They begin their journey south, and are forced to take the path through Moria, a once great Dwarven hall. With orcs hot on their tail, all but Gandalf make it through Moria into refuge at Lothlorien. At this point, the fellowship has already begun to break up, and coming events are likely to sunder it completely.</p><p>I had high expectations going into this, though I also was a bit open minded about the fact that it wasn't going to stick 100% to the text. I was very much pleased with the results. I will certainly be purchasing these movies on DVD when that opportunity arises (3 years from now?). There are, obviously, things which were completely removed, things which were changed, and things which weren't explained, but they are not so serious to detract from truly enjoying the film.</p><p>The stellar character turned out to be Legolas, who I have to admit wasn't really on my radar from the book. He was just a bad-ass. His prowess with a bow was amazing. There are subtle and not-so-subtle things that come out through the movie, like him walking on top of the snow while everyone else trudges through it. My favorite and the most memorable scene for me from the movie at this point is during the final fight with the Orcs, when he uses an arrow to stab an Orc in the head and then draws the same arrow back and fires into the next victim.</p><p>I'm not sure there's much else I need to say, since anyone who wants to see this movie isn't going to be swayed by anything I have to say. Another positive note is the fact that my wife, who has never read the books and knows nothing of the story, enjoyed the film quite a bit and was able to follow things well. She's not going to catch the small things, like the elven cloaks from Lothlorien which aren't explicitly given in the film and so only someone who read the books is going to catch, but the film was really designed to meet everyone where they are at.</p><p>Go see this film. That's all there is to it. I'm a bit anxious to see what kind of numbers it pulls in. I'd be very surprised if it broke records, but I hope that it comes quite close.</p>
80136|tenthings|Video at home|2001-12-22|<p>I knew of the film when it was released mostly because I try to keep track of all the movies that are released, even if I have no intention of seeing them. This is quite obviously a high school movie, and so there wasn't a lot of motivation for me to put down good money to go see it. When you get it for free from the library, however, the hurdle is simply whether one thinks it is worth spending the time to watch. The film seemed to have done pretty well, and I was in the mood for something light-hearted and comedic, so why not?</p><p>Cameron is new in town, and as he is being shown around his new high school, his eyes fall upon the beautiful Bianca. Of course, Bianca is a vacuous, short-sighted female that only pays attention to the most popular guy in school. Oh yeah, that and her father doesn't let her date... until he decides that she cannot date until her older sister dates. The catch is that her older sister, Kat, is a shrew (this story is an adaptation of Shakespeare, though I have to be honest that I've never read or seen the original). So the next task is to get someone to date the older sister so that Cameron can get to Bianca.</p><p>I knew this was going to be somewhat fluffy. Not too serious, and many of the things that take place come as no surprise, plot-wise. What was really nice was the comedy. Some of it is standard fare, some good while some bad. Several times in the movie, they completely catch you off guard with a joke that strays from the style of humor you are expecting, and it helps punctuate those laughs. Besides the laughs, the ending is quite moving. I was surprised at how well Stiles pulled off the crucial final moment.</p><p>Like I said, this is a high school movie, but if you can get into that kind of thing, it is one of the better ones. It isn't so completely bound up in stereotypes that it bogs the film down. They're there, but not nearly as badly as in many of this genre's selections.</p>
80137|deadman|DVD at home|2001-12-22|<p>I had taken note of this film some time ago, but had never really gotten around to seeing it. I'm not all that familiar with Jarmusch, but the films of his I have seen I have liked. When I saw this available at the public library, how could I turn down a chance to watch it for free?</p><p>William Blake, an accountant from Cleveland, arrives in Machine to take up a position at the local metalworks. Unfortunately, he is about a month too late and the position has been filled. This being the old west and William being totally out of place, one thing leads to another, and he shoots the son of his former prospective boss. The remainder of the film is him running, with the aid of Nobody, a lone Indian who has read the poetry of the more famous William Blake and mistakes our accountant for the returned spirit of the former.</p><p>After watching this film, I had a sense that there was a lot of meaning I just wasn't grasping. This doesn't mean I didn't enjoy or understand most of the film, it's just that I had a lingering feeling of missing something. The film is quite bizarre, and many things are unexpected and unexplained. There are no normal characters in this film, either. Everybody is eccentric in their own way.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed the film. There were some very memorable scenes... ones which made me laugh as well as ones that made me think. The role of chance and luck in the film are excellent, combined on some level with the reality of what it takes to shoot a gun and actually kill someone. Of course, another bonus for me was Nobody, who returned in the film <short=\"ghostdog\">Ghost Dog</a> for a wonderful cameo with the same line he uses in this film: \"Stupid fucking white man.\"</p><p>I recommend this film. Although I felt confused at times, unsure of what was going on or where things were going, it the end I enjoyed watching the film and wanted to talk about it. There are scenes in the film that are bound to pop into my head in the future.</p>
80138|wakingned|Video at home|2001-12-24|<p>Ah, the wonder of borrowing movies for free from the public library. Unfortunately, they usually don't have the best of selections and the hours aren't so good, but sometimes the schedule permits.</p><p>Michael and Jackie are two old friends in an Irish village of about 52 people (and nearly everyone else there is old as well). Taking early note of the fact that someone from Tully More has won the lottery, they begin tracking down who it is so they can butter them up before they reveal that they are the big winner. Turns out, however, that Ned Devine won, but also died from the shock. In order to claim the winnings, as Ned would want it, the whole village has to get in on the scam.</p><p>This is a fun movie, lighthearted as I expected it to be. It doesn't go deep into issues, and it throws a couple of loops you aren't quite expecting, but otherwise flows much as you'd expect it to. In the end, I wasn't disappointed at watching the film, though I dare say it wasn't as stellar as some people and critics made it out to be.</p><p>I'd recommend the film, but obviously not as anything more than it is. There are certainly better comedies out there, particularly from the British Isles, but I can understand why this one was likable.</p>
80139|oceanseleven|Edwards Cinema in Corona|2001-12-25|<p>I managed to not know anything about this film until about the time it was released. There seems to have been quite a bit of hype, but since I don't know anything about the Rat Pack and don't worship the ground upon which the lead actors of this film walk on, it wasn't so important to me. Other people said it was pretty decent, not the greatest but not the worst. Since <short=\"ali\">Ali</a> was only on one screen in the lilly-white, backwater area I was in (my roommate's grandparents live there), we had to settle for something that we didn't have to wait an hour to see.</p><p>Danny Ocean has just got out of prison and is looking to get back into the game in a big way. He's thought up a great little plan to rob three of the  most profitable casinos in Vegas. Thing is, those casinos turn out to be owned by current boyfriend of his ex-wife... the one who left him while he was in prison. With financial backing, he gathers a nice collection of underworld craftsmen to do both jobs: get the money and get the girl.</p><p>This isn't a film you go into expecting complete seriousness or amazing drama. It is for fun. And that it was. The different characters all have their funny moments, and they all develop enough character to draw a bit of you affection. Furthermore, this is a heist film, which in my opinion is usually a fun thing to watch... I never mind seeing some rich sod get his money or goods stolen.</p><p>Not much else to say. I liked the film and would recommend it to anyone as light fare. The film was what I expected and it did a good job at it. There are some inconsistencies or exaggerations (not recognizing Pitt's voice and the electronic device being the only two I can think of right now), but they don't detract from the movie.</p>
80140|evildead2|DVD at home|2002-01-05|<p>I'd been meaning to catch the rest of this trilogy for a while, but just kept putting it off. With too much money to spend, I decided to buy the last two on DVD, since I want to hear the commentary tracks. I watched all three of the movies back in high school, but to be honest couldn't remember much from them. <short=\"evildead\">Evil Dead</a> is still fresh in my head, so I expect my judgement to be clouded by that.</p><p>Ash heads out to a cabin in the woods with his girlfriend. They don't even know who the cabin belongs to, but that's a minor detail. In one of the rooms, Ash comes across the Necronomicon and a taped analysis and reading of the text by the professor who uncovered it. It moments his girlfriend is possessed and in need of decapitation. Ash soon gets infected as well, and has to cut off his hand to keep it from spreading. Then we throw in the daughter of the professor and three more people, and we have a wonderful horror film in the offing.</p><p>I'll probably add a little more to this review when I've gotten through the commentary track, but it is quite an enjoyable film nonetheless. Unlike the first movie, where much of the humor is unintentional, everything here is well placed and thought out to make light of the genre. Then there are just  the straight jokes which are nice, like using the book <strong>A Farewell to Arms</strong> to trap the severed hand. Bruce does an amazing job, and Jim Carrey has nothing on him when it comes to facial expressions and self-mutilating brutality. One of my favorite aspects was the intentional inconsistencies, like the staircase seeming about 3 stories when Ash falls down them, but then only being a few rungs when he goes back up or the fact that the undead can pull the largest member of the living through the cellar door, but are unable to get out.</p><p>You obviously have to be a bit into the genre to enjoy these films, but I'd recommend them to just about anyone. I won't regret having purchased the film, and will be certain to watch it again in the future at some point.</p>
80141|armyofdarkness|DVD at home|2002-01-06|<p>Throw our hero back to year 1300 and raise an army of undead, what more could you ask for in a film. Like I said below, I couldn't remember much of this film, and thus a great candidate for re-watching. So many people consider it the finest of the three films.</p><p>After a quick recap of the events of <short=\"evildead2\">Evil Dead 2</a>, Ash is in chains and being taken to the local stronghold for torture and execution. Luckily, Ash is quite capable of handling himself, and when he gets a chainsaw in one hand... er, or one arm, and a shotgun in the other, things are bound to go his way. But in order to return to his own time, perhaps to his dream job at S-Mart, he first has to retrieve the Necronomicon from a nearby cemetery. Sounds easy enough, if only he can remember a few words that need to be said when the book is picked up.</p><p>Where number 2 seems to pull few punches, this film is just balls out. From the very start of the film, we have the humorous inconsistency that in the end of the last film, he blew the head off the demon with a shotgun. From there, things just get wilder and wilder, and I enjoyed every minute of it. This film is also filled with so many wonderful one-liners and quotables, that it was bound to be classic from the get-go.</p><p>The version I watched was actually the \"bootleg\" director's cut of the film, with added scenes and an altered ending. I don't have a good enough memory to note any differences from the original theatrical release. There are also cut scenes which were interesting. I'll say more about the disk when I've had a chance to watch it with commentary.</p><p>If you haven't already seen this film, I'm not sure there's anything I can do to influence you into watching it. It is classic and the production is of a much higher quality than these kinds of films ever get the money to achieve. You don't need to see the first movie to enjoy this film, but I think that the second film is required viewing beforehand (though the recap does a good enough job to get you by).</p>
80142|ali|The Bridge, Howard Hughes Plaza|2002-01-08|<p>Well, we were supposed to see a pre-screening of the upcoming movie <strong>Blade 2</strong>, but apparently we didn't get in line early enough. Silly us, we should have foregone dinner and just waited outside for three hours. Anyway, the upside of the deal was that because they had already filled our demographic once we got to the front of the line, they gave us passes to see any movie for free that night. I'd been wanting to see <strong>Ali</strong> on opening day but couldn't because of circumstances (particularly location). It's been getting pretty good reviews, but has recently gotten a couple bad reviews from people who seemed to know what they were talking about.</p><p>This is a biopic of about 10 years in the life of Muhammad Ali. It begins just before the Sonny Liston fight in 1964, and runs to the Rumble in the Jungle, which I believe was 1974. There's one flashback scene to when Ali was a kid, but the rest of the movie remains squarely within this time frame. The film focuses quite a bit on his personal life. The first segment deals quite a bit with his interaction with Malcolm X and his relationship to the Nation of Islam. The next major segment is when he refuses to be inducted into the Army to fight the Vietnamese and the resulting exclusion from the Boxing world. The final segment is his comeback, ending with his knock-out of Foreman in Zaire. His relationship with Howard Cosell is also fleshed out through the film.</p><p>I was pretty hyped to see this film, which may have been a mistake. Although there were many good aspects to the film, the negative aspects are overshadowing them in my mind right now. I'll get back to the positive later.</p><p>First off, Mario Van Peebles should not call himself an actor. His portrayal of Malcolm X was simply pathetic. I've never seen something so uninspired. Admittedly, Malcolm X was an extremely charismatic individual who would be difficult for anyone to play, but I really thing Denzel Washington did a good job a few years back. Mario doesn't even come close to getting the cadence and spirit that Malcolm carried when he spoke, and even his attempts at being emotional just seem to fail. Since the movie started off with Malcolm X at the center, this unfortunately sets the tone for the rest of the film.</p><p>The film also concentrates entirely too much on little personal details, I mean the scandalous ones, of Ali's life that I just don't care about. Spoiler here, but the movie ends with a couple phrases about Ali's life after the time frame of the movie. One of the two facts they mention is when he divorced and married his various wives. Honestly, I don't care. Ali wasn't the People's Champ because of the women he slept with. He was loved and hated for what he thought, what he said and what he did in the public eye. It isn't that his wives and relationships be stripped from the movie, but they shouldn't have been as central as they were.</p><p>To be honest, the film probably also concentrated a little too much on the boxing in the ring. Will Smith did a pretty good job of imitating Ali's style during the matches (although it is painfully obvious that he isn't Ali at times), but the dramatization and camera effects in the matches didn't seem to help the film along, always. For the Rumble in the Jungle, I was actually starting to get irritated, sick of people shouting, \"get off the ropes.\"</p><p>This rips a little from a review I read the other day, but there was a lot of context missing in the film. I know a bit about Ali already, and am able to spot some of the locations because of my own knowledge, but I'm sure that doesn't hold for too many other people. You very rarely know even what city he is in, unless you pick up on little clues like the Harold's Chicken Shack in the background which is the dead giveaway that it's Chicago... if you've lived there. Politically, Ali's motivation and reasoning are not always fleshed out or supported. This isn't a complete failure, and there are a couple points in the film where they do a good job of explaining what Ali was thinking or saying at the time, particularly with regards to refusing induction. But the complete failure is the political and social context of the time. The lynching of Emmett Till, the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, and the riots following King's assassination are about the only historical relationship you get. Ali was a product of his times, and stood out not just because of who he was but also because of when he was. The movie really fails to capture this, and it is painful because there seem to be at least two points (mentioned above) where the film could have been curtailed in order to make room for these kinds of things.</p><p>I've already mentioned some of the positive points. Will Smith does a pretty good job, and I was impressed by how buff he got for the film. He is still not Ali, something obvious from his thin neck and narrow frame, but there are a few times when he does capture Ali quite well, and his speech was pretty good. Sometimes Smith just doesn't have the snap and spunk to his voice that Ali did, but he gets close. Ali's compassion and thoughtfulness are also captured, and this is an important aspect.</p><p>I cannot comment much on the relationships Ali had with the various people around him, which is an important part of the film. These are done fairly believably, though in the end I still struggled with some doubt about some of the people and how they really were.</p><p>At this point I don't think I can really recommend the film. If you are truly interested in Muhammad Ali, you are much better off getting some documentaries and reading some books. He is an inspiring figure, and I didn't feel enough of this was captured in the film to convey that to people too young today to have ever experienced it (as I am).</p>
80143|ofmiceandmen|DVD at home|2002-01-13|<p>I had never read the book on this one, though I've read a few other novels by Steinbeck which I enjoyed. A while back, maybe at the beginning of September, I caught it as a play. After telling someone who much I enjoyed the play, they told me that a movie had been done recently, with Malkovich as Lenny. I put it on my list of movies, hoping to catch it sometime.</p><p>Lenny and George travel together during the Great Depression as migrant farm workers in California. Lenny is clearly not the brightest of guys, innocent but strong. After running from a mess where Lenny had touched the dress of a woman up in Wheaton, the two surface in Soledad to work on a ranch there bucking barley. They have hopes of setting up their own place someday, buying a small ranch and living off the fat of the land. But circumstances may not make that so easy.</p><p>I just love this story, and the acting and production quality to this film are excellent, making it a wonderful viewing experience. It doesn't hit me as the kind of film that I want to come back and watch every couple years, but I cannot think of anything bad to say about the film.</p><p>It is the story and the themes it pulls out that I enjoy. I'm sure that other people pull different things, because I saw a comment somewhere about \"courage.. But, for me, this is a story of isolation. Everyone is isolated from everyone else, with the exception of the two main characters (although Lenny seems to live in a world of his own at times). Lenny helps make this clear, because people can talk to him, but you realize they are just taking to themselves. Out of all this, you want to pull hope, as each character tries to do, but many times there is little or none.</p><p>This is not an uplifting film. I think it ends the best way it can, but that still doesn't make you feel happy. George makes the choice that he has to make. Which reminds me, although I've already mentioned the good acting, I was pleased with Gary Sinise, who to be honest I have not really had much of a liking for up to this point.</p><p>Everyone should see this film, read the book or see the play at some point. I think it helps to know a little about the time period, but the story stands on its own. It is a masterpiece.</p>
80144|monstersinc|UCLA Ackerman Grand Ballroom|2002-01-18|<p>I had been wanting to see this for a while, but just never quite made it to the theater. It comes up at work every now and then, and when I look at the paper I can see it is still playing. Well, UCLA has $2 movies on Thursday and Friday nights (for students, really - not the most comfortable place to watch a flick), so after kung fu, we waded through horrible Los Angeles traffic to go catch this.</p><p>Sully and Mike are monsters who work for the power company. The thing is, the power company gets it juice through scaring little kids (the \"scream\" provides the electricity). Things are going pretty good, but there is a bitter rivalry with one of the other monsters, Randall, who wants to take Mike and Sully's top place record. Then a child accidentally makes it through the doors, which is thought to be certain death and terror to all of monster-dom.</p><p>Like all Pixar films to date, this is just wonderful visually. There are quite a few creative tricks throughout the film. Additionally, the film is quite funny in that mature but acceptable to children sort of way. Like they have been doing with previous films, there are also outtakes which add to the experience.</p><p>I don't have a lot to say about the film. Kids will definitely enjoy watching it over and over, but for me, I was happy to see it once but cannot imagine going back to watch it again. I recommend it, everyone will enjoy seeing it.</p>
80145|terminator|DVD at home|2002-01-20|<p>To be honest, it had been a very long time since I'd seen this film, and I couldn't remember any of the details, just vague pictures in my head of Kyle and Sarah Connor sleeping in a viaduct and a terminator getting crushed by some sort of press. I bought the special edition DVD because I knew I'd enjoy watching it again and will probably like the extras. I already own the second one. I'll be honest, though, I'm not looking forward to a third one, which is in its first stages of development right now.</p><p>After a terminator is sent back in time to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, the future mother of rebel leader John Connor, John and his forces send back one of their own, Kyle Reese, to protest dear old Mom. Both quickly head to a phone book (I guess in 1984 L.A., there was only one phonebook for the whole city!) and the terminator quickly guns down 2 of the 3. The real Sarah Connor, however, has a little help coming, if the police don't get in the way too much.</p><p>This is a classic of the sci-fi genre, and the special effects work is truly impressive for 1984. There are certainly holes every now and then, and oddities that a picky person will easily find, but the story is solid enough to provide for enjoyable viewing. The acting is fairly well done as well. Michael Biehn isn't the greatest, particularly at the beginning of the film, but he gets into a groove by the end. Interestingly enough, Arnold really isn't in that. I enjoyed Linda Hamilton, and felt she did a good job. The contrast with her role in the second film is quite nice.</p><p>All science fiction and action fans should have seen this film already. The DVD is well done, though I still need to make it through all the extras. Well worth the purchase already, though.</p>
80146|lepactedesloups|AVCO Theater in Westwood|2002-01-21|<p>I'd heard about this film some time ago, though I don't think it was when I was in France. I heard about it because it had broken some records, or was pretty close to it, and because it reflected some changes in French filmmaking. For me, all I really needed to know was that it was a combination of French, Hong Kong and a bit of American styles to catch my interest, that second one being the important of the three.</p><p>A few decades before the French Revolution, Versaille gets word of a beast in the countryside attacking peasants. It is being touted as evidence that the king is no longer able to protect the welfare of his people, and so a number of efforts are made to bring the killings to an end. Fronsac and Mani arrive in town to investigate (as opposed to hunt), and slowly begin piecing together the pieces of this ever so complicated puzzle. Oh, by the way, Mani is supposed to be an Iroquois shaman, though how this explains his wu shu abilities I'm not sure.</p><p>The film is a pleasure to watch, and I often found myself forgetting that I was watching a subtitled film. The action scenes are fairly well done, though there were a few times where it was hard to see what was going on. The moves, however, are delightfully brutal and inventive. The beast is also, like in all good horror films, kept off camera until quite late in the film, and although I had figured out what the beast probably was before I saw it, it comes as a bit of a surprise when you do see it.</p><p>The plot is intriguing, and I often could not see where things were leading, though major elements had fallen into place already (though not resolved). It seems that they did a fairly good job of capturing some of the elements of sixteenth century France, though of course I don't know where some of the people are pulled from except pure imagination (the fighting claws used by the... well, I'm not sure who they are supposed to be, either).</p><p>Complaints about the film. For me, I often had a feeling that the movie was about to end, although many issues were still unresolved. Not being a Hollywood film, it seemed entirely possible to leave dangling or unhappy endings, and when it continues on I was a bit uncomfortable, having sent my body the signals that I'd been getting out of the chair in the next 5 to 10 minutes. I don't know why this was. Perhaps editing techniques which viewers have come to associate with denoument were placed too early?</p><p>Other than that, I've heard comments of disappointment about the depiction of a native American in the film, but I think that has to be written off as a necessary element of suspension of disbelief.</p><p>I recommend the film to action fans. This isn't serious drama for the foreign film crowds, but fans of a good on-screen fight will not be disappointed. This certainly isn't a classic by any stretch of the term, but a fun film nonetheless.</p>
80147|blade|DVD at home|2002-01-27|<p>The obvious inspiration for this film is the upcoming sequel. I never read the comic book on this one, and missed the film when it was in the theaters, but this is my second time seeing it. I'm a little sore that I didn't get to see the free sneak of number 2, but I'll very likely see it in the theaters, because post <short=\"cthd\">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a> the bar is raised for a film which was so obviously Hong Kong influenced to begin with.</p><p>Blade is the son of a woman bitten by a vampire just about the time her water breaks. He is also a vampire hunter, who together with his companion Whistler, travels from city to city to hunt them down. In Los Angeles, something seems about to hit the fan, as the vampire Frost is uncovering the meaning of ancient texts in order to revive La Magra, the blood god, who will turn the world into vampires. We all know where this is going to lead.</p><p>This is a fun movie, which I caught on videotape some time ago. It isn't your standard vampire movie, and that certainly helps it out. It's got nice special effects, likeable characters (good and bad), and fight scenes which are fun to watch.</p><p>I'd recommend the film to any action fan. I have the notion in my head that vampire purists may not like it, but it's a well done movie that's worth a look.</p>
80148|timeandtide|DVD at home|2002-01-27|<p>Missed this one when it had a short run at the art theaters. I guess I didn't hear enough about it in time to get me excited. I cannot say that I ever got excited, but since it is Tsui Hark, it is worth a try. The DVD has director's commentary, though I haven't listened to it yet, but this is an added bonus I hope to partake of soon.</p><p>Jack gets a job as a bodyguard after finding out he got a one-night-stand pregnant. The money is good, and he slips most of it under her door. She had actually been a police officer and a lesbian, so she doesn't really want to have anything to do with him. Jack hooks up with Tyler, a mercenary with the skills to pay the bills, as a friend, but then becomes involved in some of Tylers other problems.</p><p>This was a pretty good film. I remember people complaining that things were a bit hard to follow, but I didn't have any trouble. Perhaps it's just my familiarity with the medium. And, like many Hong Kong films, although there is some resolution, it doesn't have the Hollywood happy ending that one would expect.</p><p>Nicholas Tse is one of the hot stars in Hong Kong right now, so it should be expected that he is going to be picked up for the better scripts. He does a good job, as do the other actors in the film. From my vantage point, there is only one glaring problem with the film, and that is that everyone from Brazil is speaking Spanish instead of Portuguese. I guess they figured they could get away with it in Hong Kong, but here in L.A. even without being able to speak it, I'm so used to hearing Spanish spoken that I know the difference.</p><p>The film doesn't move me. I liked it, but it doesn't shoot up there as a \"wow\" kind of film. There are some very nice stunts, and it is nice that the main action is actually not by the main star, who barely fires a gun in  the whole film. I do have another complain, and that is the relative absence of Cathy Tsui from the film. She's quite attractive but incredibly under-used.</p><p>This is a worthwhile film. It doesn't break any ground, but it is enjoyable as a Hong Kong bullet ballet.</p>
80149|kotd|DVD at home|2002-01-31|<p>I caught this <short=\"kotd\">movie</a> when it was in the theaters, because, after all, I am a Jet Li fan. I liked it a lot, in  particular because the fighting struck me as more realistic on the whole, and because I really got into the accupuncture needles idea. I've bought the DVD (though I have to get a new one since there are data problems on it), and will certainly enjoy it again in the future. I'll add my comments about the commentary track here once I get a new copy.</p>
80150|titanae|DVD at home|2002-02-01|<p>Yeah, I know this film got dumped on when it was in the theaters, but the animation still looked pretty cool. That's about all I remembered when I saw it at the library, so I borrowed it. I didn't bother to notice that Don Bluth was part of the production, or I may have been more hesitant, since I'm not typically into children's movies.</p><p>As the film starts, our young hero, Cale, is pre-pubescent and happy on Earth. Then dad shows up, spirits him off before the Earth explodes, and other than the fact that they are separated, we know nothing except that dad has taken the Titan project into hiding. Enter Cale after years of growing up and working for some alien scrap yard. Mysterious guy shows up, reveals to Cale that he is the only one who can find the Titan, and that humanity can be saved if Cale is up for it. Throw in asian-featured Akima as a love interest, and the rest of the movie is set. There are some twists and turns, but this is for kids, so we know the ending... happy.</p><p>Actually, that's a bit harsh. For me, there were several things which were unexpected. This wasn't a horrible film to watch, though I couldn't be motivated to ever watch it again. It's feel-good, and the premise is fairly cool. Must of the background animation is amazing, but the characters themselves are standard Bluth animation, which strives more for cute and soft than anything else.</p><p>Kids should enjoy this movie, but I'm not sure about adults. It feels like it's trying to be <em>anime</em>, but is still all too American. If it is free, you aren't giving up much... I couldn't sleep anyway.</p>
80151|beingjohn|DVD at home|2002-02-02|<p>I'm a John Malkovich fan, and this film has been on my list of movies to see for quite some time. I had heard from a number of people that it was quite funny, but since my roommates had already seen it, it usually wasn't a good time to rent it. With them out of the picture this weekend, it was the perfect opportunity.</p><p>Craig's a puppeteer, but there isn't much money in that... mostly just black eyes and busted lips. His wife, Lotte, convinces him that he should take a job. He gets hired as a filing clerk on the 7 1/2 floor of a building, and quickly falls in love with Maxine, who works on the same floor (he clearly wasn't very happy with Lotte, anyway). But Maxine wants nothing to do with him. After pulling out a file cabinet in his office, Craig uncovers a door leading into a tube. At the end of the tube. 15 minutes inside the mind of John Malkovich and then you are dumped on the New Jersey Turnpike. He tells Maxine about this, and they start a business where people can pay $200 and be John Malkovich for 15 minutes (no control, of course, just seeing through his eyes and feeling what he feels). Then Lotte goes in, discovers that she really would rather be a man, and that she's in love with Maxine as well. Things just get really weird from there (as if they hadn't been already).</p><p>This movie is both bizarre and hilarious. But in the end, the bizarre is what sticks with you. I cannot remember any of the jokes right now, but I can remember just how screwed in the head all of the characters were. All three of the main characters are just seriously wrong. That doesn't mean that they aren't likable in some way, but I never really got attached to any of them. And the way they react to their different situations is some serious commentary on how messed up people are in this society.</p><p>I know that this doesn't sound like a great review, but I really liked this movie. Oh yeah, and the puppeteering is wonderful, truly amazing stuff. I also recommend the extras on the DVD, which are quite nice and quirky in their own way.</p><p>This really isn't a movie you can explain to someone who hasn't seen it. I recommend it, and would have to place it in an \"intellectual comedy\" category if I had to tell you what it is.</p>
80152|bridgetjones|DVD at home|2002-02-02|<p>Ah, Renee Zellweger, who I have always managed to confuse with Joey Lauren Adams. Of course, upon refection, this is because I've never seen a movie with Renee in it. This movie only caught my attention because my roommate was reading the book at one point. I know that they are pushing for an Oscar nomination, so I've seen it in the papers here. As a free movie from the library, I figured Toshiko and I could enjoy watching it.</p><p>Bridget begins us off around New Years. As is the custom, her mom tries to set her up with some available bachelor during this time of the year, and thus the opportunity to reflect upon her 32 years of singledom. She makes some resolutions that will hopefully prevent the same set of circumstances the following year. Problem is, she's attracted to her boss, who soon requites that notion.</p><p>This is a wonderfully funny film, which is intellectually stimulating at the same time it is playing to some base humor. Bridget is very likeable as a character, and manages to get herself through some interesting situations. Time flies, and the movie covers the expanse of a little over a year, but we are having fun.</p><p>I don't have a lot of analysis for the film. Just see it, provided you can handle a quality romantic comedy. I can now distinguish between Renee and Joey... Joey's cuter with a higher-pitched voice whereas Renee seems a bit more down-to-earth, and quite possibly a better actress.</p>
80153|xmen|DVD at home|2002-02-05|<p>This is actually the third times I've seen this film. I saw it in the theater (which unfortunately I remember more for the horrible experience before the movie) and on DVD when I originally bought it. I got home from work yesterday after a very, very long day and didn't feel like doing anything. So, I ordered a pizza and put in X-Men. I never read the comic too closely, picking up an issue here and there when I was a kid, reading some of the early issues, and getting some of the independent series when they came out (I remember Wolverine and Nightcrawler, specifically).</p><p>Certain human beings undergo a mutation during adolescence, triggered by a traumatic or highly emotional event. After their mutation, they have some sort of super power, though the power is different from individual to individual. Rogue can steal the life force from people, and powers from other mutants, simply by touching their skin. Wolverine heals at an incredible rate and has had an adamantine skeleton afixed to his regular one, including some nice retractable claws on his knuckles. Storm has the power to control the forces of nature. Professor X can read and control minds. Magneto can generate magnetic fields and control anything metallic. The thing is, regular humans are all in a huff about this potential \"danger.. Magneto realizes that there is a war coming, and decides to make a preemptive strike. Prof. X thinks there is a better way to go about it, and while running a school for \"gifted\" children also cooperates with the government.</p><p>I still think the greatest scene in this movie is right at the beginning, when we see Magneto first realize his powers. It is a death camp, some time in the late 30s or early 40s, and his parents have just been separated from him to never be seen again. Now this is a traumatic experience, and it also sets up the reason why Magneto has the approach he does... he sees what humans are fully capable of.</p><p>The action in this film is quite nice, the special effects are well done,  and the characters are all pretty cool. The exceptions are of course Cyclops, who is actually well done, but has always just been a prick even in the comic book. Halle Berry doesn't get enough screen time or lines, either, and has the worst lines in the film (\"Do you know what happens to a toad when it gets struck by lightning... The same thing that happens to everything else.\"). The \"bad\" guys are also very likable, and to be honest Magneto garners my highest respect.</p><p>If you haven't seen this movie, it rocks. Watch it!</p>
80154|thesword|DVD at home|2002-02-06|<p>This film first came to my attention when there was a film festival a while back. They showed it the day after they showed <short=\"xianu\">A Touch of Zen</a>, but I had other obligations. So yesterday I stopped at a public library on the way to see a friend and discover that they have this incredible cache of Chinese movies. Needless to say, I'm planning on stopping by there whenever it is convenient.</p><p>Wah is the greatest swordsman, and everybody knows it but no one can find him since he went into retirement. Li is a young swordsman of definite skill, who is looking for Wah. Throw three women into this plot: a young woman who Li helps out and obvious love interest, an old flame who is now married to an evil swordsman, and the love interest of Wah. Li finally gets to fight Wah, losing but striking a blow to the ailing man. When Wah dies, the daughter assumes it is from Li's strike, but in fact it was from the evil swordsman who is out to collect the two named swords from Wah.</p><p>This film is all about sword fighting, and there are many fight scenes. You should be warned, however, that this is really a culmination of 1970s styling, so although the swordfighting is fast, it is still somewhat contrived. The swordsmen also have jumping abilities, though nothing as extreme as more well-known wuxia films. The plot is essentially there to help out the action.</p><p>Unfortunately, the disc I was watching wasn't the best quality, quite scratched up. What this meant was that the already slow pace, combined with a somewhat confusing leap in plot at times was additionally confused by the disc deciding to skip back or forward a few chapters twice. Otherwise, though the quality of the print was impressive. It looks like a Seventies film produced more recently.</p><p>I cannot really recommend this film, since the sword fighting doesn't strike me as realistic enough or flashy enough, but somewhere in between. I can see how the movie influenced later film-making, but I wouldn't be motivated to  watch it again.</p>
80155|legendofzu|DVD at home|2002-02-07|<p>I saw the preview for this film recently, although I had heard about it sometime last year. The library had the ChinaStar release of this film, which I grabbed as soon as I saw it. Apparently, the movie has been picked up by Miramax and they've sucked up all the rights, so this disc is no longer available for sale (legally at least). I wonder how badly they'll butcher it. In any case, this is a remake (in theme, not in exact storyline) of the original <short=\"zu\">Zu</a> movie from 1982, which is in turn based on a series of Chinese books.</p><p>The evil force, Insomnia, destroys Kun Lun mountain, and King Sky is the only survivor. 200 years later, Insomnia is back again, this time to destroy the last of the holy temples, Omei. King Sky steps in to help, with the aid of Red, Hollow/Ying, Thunder, and Enigma (who is the reincarnation of King Sky's old teacher, and his love interest). Along the way, Red is left to guard the entrance to the Blood Cave, and ends up getting possessed by an evil fairy of some sort. The final battle has be set.</p><p>This film is 100% about special effects. Although technically this is the spawn of swordfighting movies (and everyone has their \"sword\"), everything is done with computers. It is actually quite amazing. I have to say that Red's wing-style swords are the coolest. Everything is very well done, and there are times when you cannot really tell if the background is real or animated.</p><p>The story is interesting, although it may be hard to follow for some. I was happy to see Sammo Hung return as White Eyebrows. There are quite a few characters in the film, but they are unique enough that you are able to sort them out, even if you cannot understand what they are doing in the movie in the first place. Zhang Zi Yi is looking quite cute, but her character isn't central to the plot and I had to go back and watch a scene to even figure out what she was doing... her part feels thrown in.</p><p>If you liked the first movie, you are very likely going to enjoy this one as well. This is the direction that Hong Kong fantasy movies have headed in, although they aren't churning out nearly as many as they were in the early 1990s. I'm not sure yet if I'll watch it again when it is released in U.S. theaters, but probably.</p>
80156|firestarter|Video at home|2002-02-10|<p>I've been wanting to go back and watch this film for a while. I saw it shortly after it came out, perhaps on a movie channel of some sort, and haven't seen it since. I still vividly remembered little Drew Barrymore hurling fireballs, which in itself is enough to make a fun movie. Mmm, pyrokinesis.</p><p>Charlie is the daughter of two students who subjected themselves to scientific drug tests during the Sixties. As a result, they gains psionic powers. After the mother is killed, Charlie is on the run with her father, Adam, since the government agency which drugged them in the first place would like to get their hands on this amazing little weapon. The Shop, as it is called, has a demented George C. Scott to hunt for them and induce the girl to perform their experiments once she is captured. But, when you play with fire, you're going to get burnt.</p><p>There are plenty of problems with this film. The acting isn't all that great from some of the adults, and the script leaves something to be desired at times. There are also inconsistencies, particularly in how the father and daughter's powers work. But you don't watch this for solid story, you watch it to see a little girl blow stuff up.</p><p>Drew Barrymore, who was about 8 or 9 when the movie was made, does an excellent job and delivers the lines which make the film a pleasure to watch. Things are often quite predictable, but it is still a pleasure to see her set a fire. If only I had those abilities as a 9 year old!</p><p>This film is classic, and although it isn't the greatest production ever, it does a decent job. Watch it because it is fun.</p>
80157|bulletsoversummer|DVD at home|2002-02-11|<p>I heard the title of this film some time ago, but didn't know anything about it. When I stopped by the video store I wanted to grab a Hong Kong film, and this looked like a good choice. I like what I have seen of Francis Ng so far, so that gave me a boost.</p><p>Mike and Brian are cops, hunting down the Dragon, a criminal who likes to kill off people for fun during his robberies. They get a lead that has them staking out an apartment building. They share the apartment with an older woman who clearly isn't all there. In the meantime, Brian's hormones lead him to hook up with a high school girl, and Mike falls for the woman who runs the laundry across the street. She's about to have a baby, and the father has already left town. To boot, Mike has some medical problems of his own.</p><p>I liked the movie. This isn't action, it's drama. There are a few scenes of gunfighting, but the bulk of the film is the interaction of the two main characters with the people around them. Things resolve in the end, in pleasantly odd ways, but this isn't superhero stuff.</p><p>I don't have much else to say. The subtitles can come a little quickly at times, since the dialogue is important at times. The Brian character is good for quite a few laughs, and Mike is endearing. Some things don't make a lot of sense, like Brian's interaction with the high school girl, but it is all acceptable suspension of disbelief.</p><p>I'd recommend the film, but like I've already said, don't watch it thinking you are in for non-stop action. This story is more about characters.</p>
80158|kingofbeggars|VCD at home|2002-02-12|<p>When I grabbed this off the shelf at the library, I couldn't remember if I'd even heard of it. Now that I've seen the DVD cover on the internet, I know that I had heard of it, but hadn't really registered it. I didn't even realize that this was a Stephen Chow film until I got home, the graphics on the VCD cover were quite small. I guess I should have had my suspicions, with the word \"King\" in the title.</p><p>Chan is the illiterate son of a general, and although quite talented in martial arts, he is not the most promising of youngsters. Early on, he encounters a superior martial artist in a brothel, but the confrontation is diffused. He then proposes to Yushang, who conditions her consideration of marriage upon him being a superior martial artists. So Chan (actually, So Cha He Yee Chan) heads to the capital to compete for a Martial Scholar position. Although clearly superior martial arts wise to his opponent, the judge is his opponent's uncle, so he loses. When the opponent dies, he wins, but then it is revealed that he cheated on his written test. The emperor punishes his father and him to be beggars for the rest of their lives.</p><p>This is a good film, quite funny, with some enjoyable martial arts choreography. The story actually turns serious at times, and remains loyal to a fairly consistent plot while throwing in fights and humor as needed. Some things are a bit predictable, but the \"Sleeping Disciple's Fist\" which Beggar So (and I'm not sure if this is meant to be the same Beggar So who shows up in Wong Fei Hung movies) learns is a bit of a loop and quite fun.</p><p>Stephen Chow has a certain type of humor, and if you know you like him already then you will certainly enjoy this film. If you have never seen one of his films, this is as good as any to start with.</p>
80159|karatekid|DVD at home|2002-02-13|<p>Ah, the American equivalent to the <strong>36th Chamber of Shaolin</strong>. This isn't to say that it is as good, but it is the quintessential martial arts training film for the American cinema. Unfortunately, it is karate, but you can't have everything, where would you put it. In any case, I'd been hankering to see this film again for quite some time. I found it at the library.</p><p>Daniel and his mother move from New Jersey to Los Angeles (the valley, to be specific). Needless to say, Daniel doesn't fit in so well, and although he wins the eye of the very attractive Ali, at the same time he wins the ire of her ex-boyfriend and his thug friends who all study karate with a hard ass, military guy. As it turns out, Mr. Miyagi, the apartment complex's handyman, knows Okinawan karate. As their friendship grows, Miyagi teaches Daniel karate and prepares him for the All-Valley tournament, where he will face off with the ex-boyfriend to put their problems to rest.</p><p>There are a lot of good things about this film. To be honest, the martial arts pretty much suck. This is probably my general distaste for karate and tournament fighting, but it also seems that none of the people in the film really know much. But this is still a great film, because the story holds it together and is enjoyable. Daniel is a fairly sympathetic character, the classic underdog that most of us could cheer for. The training scenes are nice. And Pat Morita does an excellent job. My biggest pleasure with watching it now is to see how much Japanese is thrown in.</p><p>The real downside to this film is the bad guy, or rather, the sensei of the dojo where all the thugs learn karate. Although it provides an essential plot element, and helps make the point that there are no bad students, only bad teachers, the guy still isn't believable. It isn't hard to believe that people like that exist, but it is hard to believe that they could maintain a money-making martial art studio for very long without incurring the wrath of both the parents and numerous lawsuits. That the third film tries to one-up this guy means that that film isn't even worth watching.</p><p>As I sit here writing these reviews, it strikes me that 1984 was just a very good year for American movies. This movie is no exception, and is a classic of Hollywood that anyone should enjoy. Besides, where would martial arts be in this country if it wasn't for this flick?</p>
80160|beyondthemat|DVD at home|2002-02-16|<p>I've been wanting to see this for a long time, but had to wait for it to come of the \"new release\" shelf, so that I could have it out for more than one night. I was a big fan of pro wrestling when I was younger, though I was more into the NWA than the WWF. I got out of it by high school (when I was never home to watch TV anyway) and have never gotten back into it, but I couldn't turn down a documentary going behind the scenes.</p><p>The director interviews quite a number of pivotal people for this film. The filming takes place over about 4 or 5 years, starting around 1995. Apparently, the WWF tried to prevent this movie from coming out at all. It reveals how much of a prick Vince McMahon really is, and goes into the private lives of individual wrestlers, as well as covering the independent circuits which are farm leagues of a sorts. The central wrestlers interviewed in depth are Mick Foley (aka Mankind, Cactus Jack, and Dude Love), Terry Funk, and Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts.</p><p>This is a moving and emotional film at times, and certainly revealing. My mother would get quite upset at times watching this stuff when I was a kid, because she'd say that people were really getting hurt, while my dad would say that it is all fake. Fact is, they are really getting hurt. If you see blood, then chances are it is the real deal. Basically, these people are getting paid (and not very well, usually) to brutalize themselves. Obviously, many of the moves are designed to make noise and look flashy while not hurting anyone too seriously, but nobody is perfect. Things are choreographed, but only on a loose basis, and much of the match is ad lib.</p><p>The really moving parts of the film are the personal lives of the individual wrestlers. Mick Foley has two children, and since Mick seems to have taken more bodily injury than any other wrestler in history, it's interesting to see how he explains it all to his kids. In particular, we get to see the reaction of his wife and kids during one of his last matches as Mankind, when he lost the title to the Rock. I cried. Jake Roberts' story is also quite amazing, because he has lived a life that would pull most people down... and Jake is like most people.</p><p>If you like wrestling at all, you should see this film. It probably won't  change your opinion of pro wrestling, but it will give you a deeper understanding of what is going on. I grew up on this stuff, and I'm glad that this movie was made.</p>
80161|forbiddencitycop|DVD at home|2002-02-16|<p>I've gotten into a bit of a Stephen Chow mood, so I rented this for the long weekend. I don't know anything about it except what I've already mentioned.</p><p>Ling Ling Fat (that's 008) is a secret agent for the emperor, but unlike the other agents, he does not know any fantastic kung fu. Instead, he spends his time making inventions (most of them quite modern in influence, if not design). When a plot arises to kill the emperor, it is up to Fat to foil it, but the emperor has decreed that he doesn't want to see or hear Fat. After that, the emperor entrusts Fat to check out a particular prostitute, who is rumored to be quite beautiful, to ensure that she is safe.</p><p>The style of Stephen Chow's humor is fairly consistent, but does not get repetitive. His jokes are fresh and often unexpected. Obviously, a lot of the humor is easier to grasp if you have some understanding of Hong Kong and Chinese culture. To boot, this movie has a couple of really attractive women with a lot of screen time.</p><p>Like I've said before, if you've never seen a Stephen Chow film, pick one up today. The best ones are like this one, where he is the lead and central actor.</p>
80162|payback|DVD at home|2002-02-17|<p>I remember that this movie didn't do well in the theaters, and that many critics seemed to pan it. I also remember that it looked good when I saw the trailer. Brainstorming for movies to see, I made this suggestion to the roommates, and here we are.</p><p>Porter has been doublecrossed, and all he wants is his money. That would seem kinda simple, but he has a whole crime organization to deal with. To boot, he doesn't really have too many people he can count on. Luckily, he does have the skills to pay the bills.</p><p>Porter is an anti-hero, and the title of this movie says it all. You don't watch this film because you expect the main character to be a nice guy, you watch it because you feel good when he gets payback. Just when you seem to think that he is a nice guy, he surprises you. The movie is well-crafted, and although you can expect that things will turn out in the end (it is Hollywood, of course), the twists and turns along the way are thoroughly enjoyable.</p><p>I highly recommend this film. It isn't intellectual, just old fashioned fun and violence. Although not graphic or gorey, there are few punches pulled, because Porter knows what it is going to take to get his share of the money.</p>
80163|miyamotomusashi1|DVD at home|2002-02-18|<p>I've been wanting to see this film (or series of films, actually) for a long time, but have just never gotten around to it. I've even been tempted to buy them, but have held back so far. I read the translated version of Yoshikawa Eiji's books back in high school, which is what the movie is based off of. I borrowed this from a co-worker for the weekend, knowing I'd have time.</p><p>Takezo is young and unattached to much, unlike his friend Matahachi, who has a mother to take care of and a fiance, Otsu. They both run off to fight in  the battle of Sekigahara (1600), to make a name for themselves as samurai. On the losing side, they hide up in a cottage with a mother and daughter while Matahachi's wounds heal. After bandits come, Matahachi runs off with the two women while Takezo returns to their home village, where he quickly becomes a criminal. The monk, Takuan Soho, captures Takezo and puts him on the path of becoming a samurai, renaming him Miyamoto Musashi.</p><p>Much of this story is historical, although it is historical fiction at its core. Takuan was a famous monk (I've read one of his books), and of course Miyamoto Musashi is quite famous (his \"Book of Five Rings\" has been translated for abuse quite often, particularly during the phase in U.S. business-speak when the \"Japanese model\" was being looked up to). Although this movie only covers the beginnings, it is quite a good story in and of itself. I do look forward, however, to seeing the rest of them. I was pleased to see how much of the book I remembered as it came out on screen.</p><p>The DVD is from <a href=\"http://www.criterionco.com/\" title=\"Criterion Collection\">Criterion</a>, so I knew it was going to be good, but this print is amazing. The color is incredibly sharp and vivid, and the sound is nice as well. Although primarily shot in studios, the scenes are still quite beautiful, and only a few of the scenes are dark (and always with good reason).</p><p>I don't know the history of the books or the movie, but in any case, the movie is enjoyable to watch. The characters are quite interesting, however tragic. I recommend this film to anyone who appreciates old films, because this one surely rises above your average chanbara.</p>
80164|ghostworld|DVD at home|2002-02-18|<p>I never read the comic book on this one, but it looks sorta interesting. My roommate got it in her head to see it, and I was willing to support that decision. I didn't know ahead of time that Zwigoff had directed it, because that would have helped lean me in its favor.</p><p>Enid and Rebecca have just graduated high school (well, sorta). Neither are headed off to college, and they are looking to move into an apartment together. Enid befriends Seymour, who is at least twice her age, and gets into an odd relationship with him. Meanwhile, her and Rebecca are drifting apart, as Rebecca is taking on responsibility and facing the real world while Enid hangs on to her fantasy. Throw in the remedial art class which Enid has to take to get her diploma, and that pretty much sets up the story.</p><p>This is a teen movie that tries to break some molds. In the end I wasn't very satisfied with it. Enid is not a likable character at all for me. I've seen too many people like her, rejected from mainstream society and thus rejecting society back without any clue as to what some of the problems might be. Of course she is young, but whereas her friend Rebecca seems to be making some progress at least with coping with reality, Enid doesn't seem to be (or want to be) going anywhere. Everybody's a dork, everything's lame, and that's about it.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. There are some laughs throughout it, but the movie as a whole doesn't mix up well to feel like I got anything from it. I wasn't even depressed, since I didn't have any emotional  attachment to Enid by the end of the film to be depressed for her.</p>
80165|madmax|DVD at home|2002-02-18|<p>I watched this <short=\"madmax\">movie</a> about 6 months ago. The difference is that now I own the special edition DVD which has the original Australian dialogue. My roommate was in the mood to watch it.</p><p>Nothing much to add except that there is really no good reason for this film to have ever been dubbed. If there are any problems, it is with the slang, and not with the accents. But to be honest, since this is a future dystopia film anyways, the slang is better. I'm glad I got the DVD, the quality on the film is pretty good, and there are two separate commentary tracks which I'll have to watch through at some point.</p>
80166|royalwarriors|DVD at home|2002-02-20|<p>Also know as <strong>In The Line of Duty</strong>, this is one of Michelle Yeoh's early movies. I didn't know much more than that about it when I got it from the library, but that's really enough.</p><p>Michelle, Henry and Michael are on a plane transporting a criminal back from Japan to Hong Kong. One of the criminal's friends kills the police escorting him and they hijack the plane together. Michelle, a HK cop, Henry, an ex-cop from Japan, and Michael, air security, work together and end up killing the two. But the problem is, they still have friends and those friends are bent on revenge. That takes us through to the end of the movie.</p><p>Yeah, the plot on this one isn't anything special. The real gem of this film is the fight choreography, which is fairly tight. Of course, a lot of the punches are wild haymakers, which seems to contradict the efficiency of most of the other techniques, but all-in-all it is a pleasure to watch. I'll have to warn you, though, many other parts are just sappy.</p><p>If you are bent on a good plot, then avoid this one. If you can enjoy some well-crafted fight scenes and ignore the rest, this film is fun. Overall, I probably couldn't recommend it to many people.</p>
80167|drunkenmaster3|DVD at home|2002-02-21|<p>I'd heard about this film a long time ago. Essentially, the story I got was that Lau Kar Leung got fed up with the production of <short=\"dm2\">Drunken Master II</a> and decided to make his own film. Lau plays the Chinese official in the aforementioned film, who gets killed by a hatchet man. In  any case, I figured I'd give this one a try, since I couldn't identify most of the other movies at the library this time.</p><p>The movie takes place in the first couple decades of this century. Sun Yat-Sen is referred to, and several of the characters are revolutionaries who owe allegiance to him. The bad guy is the General Yuan Shih-Kai, who is also an actual historical figure. Yeung Kwun kidnaps the general's wife (or wife-to-be, I'm not sure) because she has a ring (from the White Lotus Sect) that helps legitimize Yuan's leadership, somehow. She gets passed on to Wong Kei-Ying, who in turn entrusts her to his son, Wong Fei-Hong. Everyone gets together in a grand reunion at the end which makes for some good fighting.</p><p>The production values on this film are pretty high, and so the quality of the film itself is good even if the plot is kinda weak. What is really nice about this movie is that there are three different people who use Drunken Fist kung fu to fight. What is especially significant here is that no one actually drinks (if you've seen the Jackie Chan films, you know that's a major element in fighting ability there). It's pretty nice, and Lau Kar Leung and company are excellent fight choreographers, so you get to see some excellent wu shu skills displayed. The fighting is evenly paced and beautiful to watch, and the techniques are often quite clear.</p><p>Other than the fighting, a lot of the film verges on silly. It isn't  unwatchable, just not very convincing. The White Lotus Sect is patently absurd, and the whole premise to the final scene is a big let down. I know that there were some wild interpretations on christianity in China at the time, but this stuff goes beyond suspension of disbelief. There is one  silly aspect, though, that I really liked... Wong Fei-Hong uses an abacus as a skateboard. It also gets used in some of the fights, though the best is just the initial bewilderment of seeing it used that way.</p><p>If you want to see a lot of good, clean fighting, then pick up this film. If you need a strong and engaging story to keep you watching, then stay away.</p>
80168|miyamotomusashi2|DVD at home|2002-02-24|<p>This is the second part of the Musashi series. I watched the <short=\"miyamotomusashi1\">first movie</a> last weekend. I would plan on seeing the trilogy completed within the next week or so.</p><p>Musashi has been traveling for about a year, making a name for himself. As the movie begins, we see him as he takes on Baiken, a kusarigama master. It is at this juncture that he meets the little boy who wishes to be his student (in the novel, the boy plays a more prominent role). Then we go off to Kyoto to catch up with the rest of the characters: Otsu waiting patiently by Sanjo bridge, Matahachi descending further into his tragic mess, and Akemi who is simply a pawn of her mother. We also get introduced to Sasaki Kojiro, who I can already tell you will be the final battle in the third movie. This movie centers around the conflict with the Yoshioka sword school, which has once been famous but is now clearly in descent.</p><p>Like the previous installation, this movie is enjoyable to watch, mixing a few swordfights into what is otherwise a drama. The color transfer on the DVD is magnificent as well. Unlike the first movie, which stands on its own, this movie needs the previous movie and the next movie to really work. It should not be watched out of sequence, because the characters are just not going to make as much sense (of course, Otsu just may be hard to understand anyway).</p><p>This is a good movie, with good acting, particularly on the part of Mifune. I recommend it, but as I just said, watch it in sequence with the other films, since it is not meant to be watched on its own.</p>
80169|beyondhypothermia|DVD at home|2002-02-26|<p>Although I didn't know it when I got it from the library, this is a Johnnie To film. It had pretty high ratings on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Database\">IMDB</a>, so I marked it as next for my library borrowing. The downside is that you do get what you pay for, and for some reason most of the library's discs have managed to acquire some bad scratches.</p><p>Our heroine (who never gets a real name) is an assassin, hired to do various jobs in Asia. She is pretty stone-faced, has a body temperature lower than normal, and her only social contact is with the lover of the guy who trained her (she coordinates the missions). Then she falls for the noodle vendor across the way from her apartment. Problem is, she has to move every three months for safety. Then, after a job in South Korea, she ends up with a vicious guy out for revenge.</p><p>This was a pretty good film. Not top of the line, and there was still a little distance between the viewer and the heroine that I'm sure hindered the film a bit, but I'm glad to have seen it. The action gets mixed up with the romance and drama fairly well, and makes for a good story. She is a pleasure to see in action, which somewhat surprised me because she doesn't look very physically up to it when you first see her on screen.</p><p>My only real complaints aren't with the film, but with the disc. I had to skip a full 5 minutes of the film because the DVD was so badly damaged and couldn't get through it. This scene was right after the incident in South Korea, which certainly helped set up the ending of the film. That, unfortunately, is also where the disc went haywire. It took me some time before I finally pieced that together, which drew off of its dramatic effect.</p><p>I would recommend the film to Hong Kong fans as a pretty good film. My only caution is to rent it... don't borrow it from the <a href=\"http://www.lapl.org\" title=\"Los Angeles Public Library\">Los Angeles Public Library</a>, their copy sucks.</p>
80170|memento|DVD at home|2002-03-04|<p>I had been wanting to see this movie for some time. I didn't really hear much about it when it was in the theaters, but it has come up in lunch conversation at work many times, and a number of other people I know have mentioned that it is a very interesting film. Of course, one friend did mention that there was a German film from some years ago with a very similar concept which he said was actually much better, but until I can track that down this will have to do.</p><p>Leonard Shelby has a brain disorder, suffered when burglars broke into his house and raped his wife. He cannot retain short-term memory. He can remember things just fine from before the accident, but cannot remember anything anew. Leonard remembers things through polaroids, notes and tattoos. His reason for living is to avenge the death of his wife, but it is very difficult for him to put together the clues and track things down. He also has to be very careful of someone taking advantage of his inability to remember.</p><p>This film is quite good, and although the way in which the movie is  structured is part of the selling point, it is interesting without that. The movie runs in reverse, so that we see Leonard killing someone at the beginning of the movie, and then backtrack from there. And, of course, the movie tries to get us to question our own memory, our own understanding of what is going on. What are the facts that are unraveling. Who is telling the truth, if anyone is?</p><p>I definitely recommend the DVD. I didn't get through the director interview, but there is one extra which has clips from supposed journals, medical records, police reports, etc. that help nail down some of the events of the film. Even then, there are still questions lingering. It is clear what kind of person Natalie is, but Teddy is still open. Leonard, in the end, is also left open.</p><p>The movie is quite interesting and involves you in what is going on. There are also rather funny parts. In particular, I liked the guy running the inn where he stays. The film is also very well put together, and took a lot of work to craft.</p><p>I certainly recommend this film to everyone. Although I won't have time to watch it again before the movie is due, it is one of those films that many people will want to watch at least twice. Check it out.</p>
80171|13thwarrior|DVD at home|2002-03-08|<p>I've been wanting to see this one for a long time, but just never got around to it, for a number of reasons. First off, it was pretty dumped on by critics, so I was hesitant to see it for fear that it was as bad as they said it was. But, this movie had a few things going for it. First off, vikings... nothing more need be said. To boot, I have read the book, and so I knew that it was a re-interpretation of <strong>Beowulf</strong>. My roommates were looking forward to seeing it as well, when I mentioned it, so it got put at the top of the queue.</p><p>Ibn Fahdlan has essentially been exiled for giving too long of a glance at one of the wives of an influential man in Baghdad, so he is sent off as an ambassador. He eventually meets up with some Northmen, and while with them a boy arrives to see the Northmen's assistance in destroying the menace to King Hrothgar's lands. The old soothsayer comes in and says that 13 warriors must go, and that the 13th must not be a Northman. Since Omar Sharif isn't exactly a young man, we all know this is going to be Antonio Banderas. From this point, we get a new slant on the <strong>Beowulf</strong> story, a sort of \"what might have really happened\" view of things.</p><p>If you don't know the original story, this movie is still enjoyable. In  fact, if you aren't told, you might not even realize that this is a retelling, since the pronunciation on the names is different. The movie moves a bit slow at first, but then has steady action once it gets started, with the Northmen taking on the enemy several times before the final battle.</p><p>My major complaint about the movie would have to be with historical accuracy. Given the nature of the premise of the original book, i.e. that a manuscript has been unearthed telling the experiences of one Ibn Fahdlan while journeying in the North, there should have been a greater emphasis on getting things correct. Some things are pretty good, like the great halls. But then the layout of the village is somewhat odd. And then there are the arms and armor. People are wearing armor that just didn't exist yet, and although I cannot be sure without further research, I think there are problems with the weapons they were using. It seems that the money they would have saved on expensive weapons and armor that they did use could have been spent to hire an expert to advise them as to what should have been used.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to fans of the genre, i.e. fantasy or sword and sorcery. I can understand why other people may not like it, but I think the story is still interesting and enjoyable. It doesn't make a strong impact on you, but is still worth watching.</p>
80172|spykids|DVD at home|2002-03-08|<p>And our adventure with <a href=\"http://www.netflix.com\" title=\"Netflix\">Netflix</a> begins! I had thought about this service when I first bought my DVD player, but didn't think I had the time or money to be spending on it and never looked into it. People at work talked about it, and I went to see how their selection was. Well, at this point I have over 300 movies in the queue, and since it is located in Santa Ana, I expect the turnover to be pretty good. As for this particular movie, I'd been wanting to see it for a while and just never got off my kiester to rent it (especially since my roommates had already seen it).</p><p>Carmen and Juni's parents are your typical middle-class squares. What they don't know is that both parents are \"retired\" spies. When the two are called upon to locate former spy friends who have been captured, they end up getting captured themselves... by the host of Juni's favorite TV show (which is a front for the bad guys). When the bad guys come to ransack the house and kidnap the children, they escape and decide that it is up to them to rescue mom and dad.</p><p>I cannot say anything bad about this movie. It got fairly good reviews by professional critics, and there is a very good reason for that. This movie is watchable by children, but still has that Robert Rodriguez flare that makes it enjoyable for adults. The premise is not supposed to be 100% believable, and that's what makes it work.</p><p>There are going to be people who do not like this film, but it is going to be those stiff people out there who just cannot break a mold to save their lives. It's cute, the special effects are great, and the action is a pleasure to watch. My favorite line in the movie went something like, \"Holy shitake mushrooms.\"</p><p>I recommend this film to anyone who can enjoy a film. It's worth watching, and I look forward to the sequel.</p>
80173|mrvampire|DVD at home|2002-03-09|<p>I'd seen this movie before, perhaps a couple years ago, since I knew it was a classic. Since my friend had not seen it, I was perfectly willing to get it again, because it is quite enjoyable.</p><p>Master Gau has been hired to correct a burial problem by a local merchant. Problem is, the dead grandfather has managed to become a walking corpse. Together with his two assistants, Chou and Man Choi (who are both obsessed with the merchant's daughter Ting-Ting), they have to recapture and deal with the grandfather before he kills off the rest of his line.</p><p>Like I said, this is a classic, in fact \"THE Classic\" of this style of movie, upon which all other movies only imitate. Lam Ching-Ying is the quintessential Daoist priest as ghost hunter. There are so many wonderful elements of Chinese mythology about spirits and the undead here, mixed together with some kung fu and humor.</p><p>At its core, this movie is a comedy for me. Although the action and story are also wonderful, there are just so many genuinely funny lines and scenes in this movie. Man Choi is completely there for comedic relief, but the other characters provide their share of laughs. My favorite was from the old master himself, when he pinches another guy to make him breath first (if you hold your breath, the corpses cannot find you).</p><p>This is a must-see film, I don't care who you are. There is a part of me which is tempted to just up and buy it, though I've been trying to refrain from these urges lately. I'm sure I will see it again sometime in the future.</p>
80174|blackcat|DVD at home|2002-03-15|<p>This Hong Kong remake of <short=\"nikita\" title=\"Nikita\">La Femme Nikita</a> has been on my  list of movies to see for a long time, but kept getting put off because the friend I usually watch Hong Kong films with had already seen it. I put it at the top of my queue, and finally saw it.</p><p>Catherine doesn't get along with people too well, and quickly kills off a few Americans, including a cop, that gets her sent to jail. For some reason, there are also a number of people out to kill her (this is never explained). They manage to shoot her down before her trial, and her \"dead\" body is spirited away to some CIA headquarters where she has a small chip, the \"black cat,\" implanted into her brain. It makes her smarter and more capable, and allows her to work as an assassin for the U.S. government... stationed in Hong Kong, of course. There she falls in love with a man, and has to be careful not to reveal her jobs to him or endanger him in the process.</p><p>A lot of the good elements of this movie are stripped straight from the original film. There are some enjoyable Hong Kong additions, like an initiation where she has to kill the bride at a Jewish wedding and then make her escape under a haze of automatic gunfire. But, most of the differences don't uphold the necessity of a localized remake, though the ending is nice.</p><p>The positive aspects of this film. Jade Leung is fairly attractive, and although there are never any direct shots of her naked, you get to see a lot of her. Some of the set-ups are interesting. That's where it ended for me.</p><p>I know this is considered to be a good movie by many, but I cannot see why. It is just too cheesy, but not so bad that it crosses to B-movie status. The acting is atrocious throughout. They have Australians and other non-American English speaking folk pretending to be American. They have non-native Japanese speakers pretending to be Japanese. This wouldn't necessarily doom the movie if the people could act, but it felt like they pulled them straight off the street. Jade isn't really impressive as an actress, either. What really stood out for me was that she just didn't move her body well, either to be sexy or to be physically active. When she runs or flies in the air, it just doesn't look natural. I had incredibly suspension of disbelief problems with this film.</p><p>I would not recommend this film to anyone. As much as I heard the film's name thrown around, I would have expected something better, but this one just stinks.</p>
80175|amoresperros|DVD at home|2002-03-17|<p>A friend has seen this when it was in the theaters, and I was tempted, but it is usually quite difficult to get me to a movie theater. I had a basic idea of how the movie was set up, and knew that it wasn't going to be an uplifting film to inspire one to greatness, but I wanted to see it.</p><p>The film is three loosely intertwined stories, taking place in Mexico City. There is no direct relationship between the characters except for one event that brings them all together (though still unaware of each other). One story is of Octavio, who is in love with his brother's wife. As little as Octavio has, his brother is a dead-end loser who beats his wife. Second is Daniel and Valeria, two upper-middle class people. Daniel decides to leave his wife for his model girlfriend, but then she has an accident. Finally is Chivo, an old radical who doesn't know how to put his life back together.</p><p>Many of the characters in this movie are not very likable, but of the three core characters I did like both Octavio and Chivo. Their stories are interesting, and I could feel for them both as they tried to deal with their situations. Besides being likable, Octavio clearly has good taste in women, as Susana, his sister-in-law, is a very, very attractive woman.</p><p>The problem with this film is there isn't much you can say about it to someone who hasn't seen it, because the process of viewing the film is not something that you want to give away. You get a skewed timeline of things, and the ability to put things together as you are watching that makes the film more enjoyable.</p><p>I recommend this film. Like I said, it is not uplifting, but I also didn't find it depressing. It is worth watching, and hey, it can help you pick up any Mexican swear words you weren't already familiar with.</p>
80176|miyamotomusashi3|DVD at home|2002-03-18|<p>This is the last of the trilogy, which I have finally gotten around to watching.</p><p>As Musashi has progressed in his training, learning self-control, so has Kojiro progressed in his skills (though lacking the self-control). This movie makes a few leaps that someone who hasn't read the book might be a bit confused about, like the fact that Jotaro is now traveling with Musashi. Kojiro finally meets Musashi and challenges him to a duel, but the duel gets put off. In the mean time, Musashi spends his days farming in a remote village plagued by bandits. Unable to remain anonymous, though, both Otsu and Akemi are able to track him down. As the year passes, Kojiro sends word about when and where to duel, and the story heads towards its climactic battle.</p><p>Like the second film, this one really shines as part of the trilogy, since a lot of the assumptions in view knowledge come from the previous movies, although this one does flashback a couple times to the second movie effectively. I was pleased with how the movie ended, though I think it was a bit different from the novel if I remember correctly (the movie is slightly \"happier\"). This movie is really about capturing the \"samurai ideal.\"</p><p>I recommend this movie, though you need to see the first two beforehand. It is excellent as film, and the characters come to complete fruition.</p>
80177|pygmalion|DVD at home|2002-03-20|<p>So, when I was assembling my rather large list of films for <a href=\"http://www.netflix.com\" title=\"Netflix\">Netflix</a>, I hopped on over to <a href=\"http://www.criterionco.com\" title=\"Criterion Collection\">Criterion</a> and eventually added their whole list of films to my queue. This film stood out because I knew that my roommate had been reading the book for class. She promptly moved the movie to the top of the queue, and here we are.</p><p>Eliza sells flowers for a living and is pure London working class. Meanwhile, Henry Higgins is a professor of phonology, and most certainly middle class. On a bet, Higgins takes in Eliza as a student, promising to turn her into a \"proper lady\" in 6 months, cleaning up her cockney accent and teaching her proper manners and all.</p><p>This is a very good movie, and I think this is in large part because it is probably a very good play (I haven't read it) with good actors (well, Leslie Howard isn't great, but passable and enjoyable). There is quite a bit of humor, largely a bit sophisticated, with a lot of pokes at class in 1930s London. Eliza is a likable character, and although not very worldly at the beginning, you come to appreciate her intelligence and insight by the end.</p><p>My only real problem with the film was the ending, which was a little vague. My interpretation is that the last scene is a bit of a dream or hallucination, since it doesn't synch with the previous events or with what happens in the original. Higgins is not at all a likeable character, either, so you don't really want a happy ending for him anyway.</p><p>I recommend the film. It is drama with some comedy and social commentary, and is a good example of quality early filmmaking.</p>
80178|shiri|Video at home|2002-03-22|<p>Well, this is the movie that started me off, that began my movie reviews a little over a year ago. My first review is <short=\"shiri\">here</a>. We didn't have another movie in mind for our Friday night vigil, so I suggested this one, which I was willing to watch again. Of course, after the first 5 minutes, my sensitive roommate left the room because she couldn't take the situations. To be honest, the first five minutes are really the hardest to take for those with weak stomachs, the rest is standard action violence where needed.</p><p>Hee, an elite assassin from North Korea, is responsible for a number of political murders in the 1990s, but then she disappears with a \"Good Bye\" written in blood on her last victim. The two special agents who are after her are watching out for her to reappear, but she's effectively disappeared. That is, until some of her comrades (including her teacher) come to South Korea to steal a highly lethal weapon with plans to use it to start a war that will finally bring unification. And still, nobody knows who Hee is, or where she is.</p><p>Upon viewing this again, I think the movie is actually more sympathetic to North Koreans than I had originally thought. It is easy to understand where I was coming from the first time, since the absolute brutality of the first 5 minutes of the film can really stick in you head. But the portrayal of Hee (and here I guess it helps to have seen it once already and know what's going on) as well as the head of the special force make it clear that they aren't just mindless savages. An argument could even be made for South Korea being the bad guy at times.</p><p>This is still an enjoyable movie, and since it got a short theatrical run here in L.A. a month or so ago, perhaps it is going to become more widely available soon. One can only hope.</p>
80179|mummyreturns|DVD at home|2002-03-23|<p>I didn't really have much interest in seeing this film when it came out. In fact, the only thing that changed my motivation was that <short=\"scorpionking\">The Scorpion King</a>, which is set to come out next month, caught my eye. Perhaps it was the score which is so obviously an homage to <short=\"conan\">Conan</a>, or the appeal of the Rock, or maybe Kelly Hu. In any case, I felt like I should catch this film first (I saw the first one, which is why I wasn't so motivated to see this one).</p><p>Our heroes are exploring some ruin in northern Africa in the 1930s and come across a bracelet once worn by the Scorpion King. Several bad guys, however, need that bracelet in order to call forth and control the army of Anubis. Throw in the reincarnation of Imhotep to round out the bad guys, along with the lovely Evie having past-life regressions as the daughter of a pharaoh, and you can see how all the people are just hopelessly interconnected. Evie and Richard's son gets kidnapped (he's got the bracelet stuck on his arm) and their is a rip-roaring chase through the sands of Egypt to find the boy and prevent the bad guys from destroying the world.</p><p>I really enjoyed this movie. Why. Because it is so blatantly making fun of itself while producing an over-the-top action film. I laughed quite hard at the pygmy mummies, and there are numerous other scenes which were belly-shakers. The film doesn't worry about a lot of realistic details and simply strives for pure fantasy. To boot, who couldn't enjoy watching a couple hours of Rachel Weisz running around on screen.</p><p>This movie is pure fun, and if you can get into an action movie on this level, I definitely recommend it.</p>
80180|newdragoninn|DVD at home|2002-03-23|<p>I bought this film a while back, since I had heard enough references to it and could clearly see that the cast and production staff were up to par that I was certain I wouldn't be disappointed. It is a nominal remake of the 1967 King Hu film, <short=\"dragoninn\">Dragon Inn</a>. As soon as I can get hold of any of his films, you will see them here, but that will likely be a while. I actually started to watch this some time ago, but fell asleep because the day was just too long. At this point, I've now seen it with the commentary track as well.</p><p>After killing off a general who was threatening to report his activities to the Emperor, the eunuch sends off his children as bait for the other potential problem, Wai-on. After rescuing the kids, everyone converges on Dragon Inn, the sole inn in the desert for anyone passing this way. As the innkeeper tries to lure Wai-on with her sex appeal and the weather and other circumstances keep anyone from leaving the inn, tensions begin to mount, all awaiting the arrival of the eunuch.</p><p>This is classic Tsui Hark, beautifully done and amazing to watch. The actors are all top notch, and move the story along wonderfully. On top of all this is an ample dose of humor. I have no doubts that I will be watching this  movie again in the future, and not simply because I've already shelled out the dodge for it.</p><p>This is quality flying swordsman film without so much of the flying, but still worth watching for anyone who enjoys the genre. I recommend it for all Hong Kong fans.</p>
80181|ytumamatambien|Landmark Westside Pavilion Cinemas|2002-03-23|<p>I'm not fully sure what drew me to this movie, perhaps just a bit of raging hormones lately coupled with an appealing add. It was getting good reviews, and my reading of the plot summary grabbed me, so I ventured to the theater for the first time in a while to see the matinee. I was pleasantly surprised to find out before the movie that the lead actor was the first actor in <short=\"amoresperros\">Amores Perros</a>, which I had just enjoyed the week before.</p><p>Julio and Tenoch have just finished high school and are faced with a boring summer as their girlfriends are ready to take off to Italy. They waste away the time, getting high and thinking about sex. At Tenoch's sister's wedding, they meet Luisa, about 10 years their senior and married to one of Tenoch's cousins. They invite her on a road trip to an imaginary beach. After learning of some bad news, coupled with the infidelity of her husband, Luisa takes the boys up on their offer and the road trip and sexual tension begin.</p><p>This is a film about growing up, and it is amazingly well done. There is a lot of sex and sexual discussion in the film, but it is really done in such a way that makes you think. This is one of those movies where the more you  think about it, the more you realize how good it was. I'm not saying it is one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but it is most certainly worth watching.</p><p>The nice thing is that this film mixes up everything. It does descend into the trite garbage which Hollywood passes off as growing up. These two guys are very short-sighted and immature, and enjoy the same jokes that most teenage boys do. And as teenage boys, they are short-sighted dogs ever sniffing out for one thing. The contrast with Luisa, who is experienced and knowns what she wants, really puts them in their place, but also gives them room to grow up themselves.</p><p>The view of Mexico from this film is excellent as well. The narrative style is well-done, and you learn a little about what is going on in all layers of society. You particularly see the effects of the expanding Mexican economy (the film uses the term \"globalization\" which I think is bullshit) on the average person, as well as on the characters.</p><p>This movie isn't for kids, but it is most certainly worth watching. There is plenty to laugh at, and still plenty more to appreciate.</p>
80182|gattaca|DVD at home|2002-03-27|<p>I was inspired to see this film when I was sitting at my job a few years ago. It was a plant laboratory where I was working as an administrative assistant, and I was looking at DNA sequences that one of the researchers was looking over and noticed that the word gattaca could be spelled out with the four bases. I brought the issue up and it was confirmed that yes, this was certainly the inspiration for the name of the film. Up to that point, I knew nothing about it except for its name. I wanted to see it, but it was never as pressing as other movies, since the co-worker gave it a lukewarm review.</p><p>Vincent was born as a result of coitus, which in this distopic future is not the norm. Science has stepped in and can pre-determine most of the  essential features of any baby to be. Besides external features, this also eliminates many things like medical problems. In turn, society has used science to enforce class lines, and only those born from a test-tube mix and meeting the right qualifications can get the better jobs in society. Despite Vincent's aptitude, he cannot get any job except as a janitor. But there are ways around this, and Vincent is able to take the place of someone else in order to try to live out his dream of flying into outer-space.</p><p>I really liked this movie. Visually it is very well done, and the ideas are well thought out to make this a real piece of science fiction. What I mean is that instead of just using special effects to wow people, this film is loaded with social commentary upon our own society. This isn't a film that bowls you over, but it is a pleasure to watch. The actors do a pretty decent job, and in the end the film is quite realistic.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film. It isn't going to keep you on the edge of your seat, but perhaps it will get you to think a bit about the prejudices of this society.</p>
80183|ridingincars|DVD at home|2002-03-27|<p>When I had first heard of this film, it sounded interesting to me for some reason. But when I saw a finally saw a trailer, I wasn't impressed enough to go see it in the theater. I knew it was the story of author Beverly D'Onofrio, but I don't really know who that is or anything about her writings. My roommate rented it, so in my failing health, I decided to watch it.</p><p>Beverly has hopes of going to college and becoming something else, but gets pregnant at the age of 15 and ends up marrying a guy who is certainly no inspiring on any positive level. While raising a child, she tries to complete her high school education and later to get into college, but it ends up being a bit more for her most of the way. The movie picks up and is wrapped by the approximately 35-year old Beverly with her first book ready to be published and her son driving her to see his father after many years of absence in order to clear the final hurdle for the book.</p><p>I enjoyed the film, though I would not call it inspiring. I think the reason it appealed to be originally was that I though it was going to be a story of a young mother over-coming adversity. This young mother eventually does, but I really wasn't all that happy for her. Although the real Beverly consulted on the film, it came across as much more sympathetic to her son, in my opinion. In the end, I didn't find Beverly a very likable character and certainly not inspired in the least to look into her writings.</p><p>This isn't a horrible film, but it also isn't stellar. If you know the author, perhaps it will be more likable. There are many funny scenes and some excellent lines and insights at times, but in the end I don't feel it meshes together as well as I might hope. I wouldn't recommend the film to anyone without some knowledge of their tastes ahead of time.</p>
80184|cgs2|DVD at home|2002-03-27|<p>I've seen the first <short=\"cgs\">movie</a> a couple times, and thought it was about time to see how the sequels fare. I knew a little bit about what to expect, given that Joey Wong was going to be in this movie as well after having been finished off in the first film, but other than an odd review some time back, I didn't know much about the film.</p><p>Our hero returns to his employer to find that it has gone under and that a bunch of cannibals are running the local eatery. He gets arrested by the local authorities in a case of mistaken identity, but it helped in his escape by an old scholar. He then encounters a Daoist priest, after inadvertently stealing his horse. Soon thereafter, he meets up with Joey Wong's new character, along with a sister and several other rebels, who are planning to rescue their father from execution. Into this mix gets thrown a large monster (which looked like a goblinoid to me, but apparently was some kind of corpse monster) and some evil, body-snatching bugs.</p><p>There are a lot of cheesy aspects to this film. The corpse monster is quite bizarre. A lot of the scenes are blatantly contrived. But in the end, this is a fun movie with fun characters. The Daoist swordsman from the first film returns to kick some butt by the end of the film, thus leaving us with  no lack of fireballs.</p><p>I enjoyed this film, though it isn't nearly as good as the first one. It is very conscious of its status as a sequel, and does not try to be something it cannot be. If you enjoyed the first film and think you would like more of the same, just a little more over the top and ridiculous, then check this one out.</p>
80185|bloodlust|DVD at home|2002-03-27|<p>I saw the original <strong>Vampire Hunter D</strong> on video several years ago, after hearing enough about it to suspect that it would be one of the  few worthwhile anime out there. I was pleased, and enjoyed the story and creativity, though to this day the most memorable scene to me is when the werewolf rips the main female's sailor outfit and one of her boobs bounces out... and I do mean bounce. I laughed very hard, and still chuckle from that one. As for this movie, I was invited to see it in the theaters, but wasn't up for seeing it as a midnight showing. My roommates loved it and bought it on DVD, so while I was home sick from work, I decided to see if it was any good.</p><p>D has been hired to track down the daughter of someone obviously very wealthy, who has been kidnapped by the vampire, Meier Link. Also on the trail and in for the bounty are another group of hunters (although not half-human and half-vampire like D). As D begins to track down the daughter, he has several encounters with these other hunters as they follow Meier Link and his companion through various dangers. Along the way, he also learns a bit more about the circumstances behind the \"kidnapping.\"</p><p>I was not all that impressed with this film. It was enjoyable to watch, and the fightings and various effects were nice, but the plot seemed too obvious to me and didn't draw me in at all. None of the characters who we could potentially care about were the stuff respect is made of.</p><p>If you are a big fan of the first film, I guess you will enjoy this one, but overall I wouldn't recommend this film to the average person. It doesn't have any overwhelming characteristics that would draw me to ever watch it again.</p>
80186|bungeejumping|Korean Cultural Center|2002-03-28|<p>I didn't really know much about this film before we showed up to see it. I knew that it would be something of a romance, but that's about it. Given how few Korean films I've seen, it is pretty easy to motivate me to see one, particularly when it is free.</p><p>In 1983, In-Woo falls in love with Tae-Hee while in college. In-Woo is a particularly awkward guy, but they manage to become quickly enraptured with each other. Then, on the night that he is leaving for the military, Tae-Hee doesn't show up, and he doesn't ever seem to find out what happened to her. Fast forward to the year 2000, and In-Woo is married with a small child and  teaches at a high school. Among this year's students is a boy named Hyun-Bin who has a lot of the mannerisms of Tae-Hee.</p><p>This is one of those movies that doesn't completely fall into place until near the end. It is a love story, and the love is an undying love that cannot die. The problems that this brings up, though, when the reincarnation of In-Woo's one true love ends up being a male high school students are a bit much. This movie doesn't make you feel happy and warm by the end, but the film is somewhat uplifting.</p><p>Like I said, this is a love story with only a minor gimmick to confuse that. If that is not the kind of movie you go in for, then I wouldn't watch this, but I did like the film and would recommend it to people open to its unusual concept.</p>
80187|billandteds|DVD at home|2002-03-29|<p>This film is simply classic. I have loved it since I first saw it, and when it finally came out on DVD (although devoid of extras), it was an easy purchasing decision to make. To boot, if you haven't seen this film, you cannot properly make fun of Keanu Reeves in all of his later films.</p><p>Bill S. Preston, esquire, and Ted \"Theodore\" Logan aspire to be great musicians, with their nascent rock band, Wyld Stallions. Problem is, they don't quite have the skills it takes to pass high school. With their history final the following day, and Ted's father preparing to send him off to an Alaskan military academy when he fails, the band just may not get off the ground. And this would be very unfortunate for the universe, since their music will one day align the planets and bring about world peace. So Rufus is sent back in time to hand the boys a time machine (in the shape of a phone booth) so that they can get some first-hand input into their history final.</p><p>I cannot say anything bad about this film. It is just all around wonderful. I learned important French words, I discovered the world of San Dimas (although I haven't been there yet... must make that pilgrimage sometime), and I learned about important and historical figures. There are many great lines in the film, and the word \"excellent\" is still an essential part of my vocabulary (although <strong>The Simpsons</strong> share some guilt here as well).</p><p>If you haven't seen this film, then crawl out of your cave a got get it. It is a most triumphant film, and anyone who says differently is certainly a dickweed.</p>
80188|inthemoodforlove|DVD at home|2002-03-31|<p>I think Maggie Cheung was a big part of why I wanted to see this film. It got several good words from people I knew, and there was just something about it that attracted me. I'd heard enough good things about this film to completely overlook the fact that it was directed by Wong Kar-Wai, who has failed to impress me with any of his movies so far.</p><p>Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow are neighbors, who both move in on the same day to their cramped rooms in other people's apartments in the early 1960's. Their respective spouses are clearly having affairs, constantly out of town or coming in late at night. To boot, Mrs. Chan is often personally managing her boss's affair as well. As lonely hearts, they come together as friends, particularly around the writing of a martial arts serial for the newspaper. But they are adamant about being different from their spouses and refuse to indulge in desires which are most definitely there. Eventually, they have to part to prevent people from talking.</p><p>The acting, the cinematography and the music in this film is incredible. Overall, things are very claustrophobic, and this adds to the feel of the film. There are really no complaints I can lodge against this film on a technical or artistic level. It is, however, so deeply an art film, as Wong Kar-Wai is so hopelessly an art film director. The characters are interesting, and their motivations understandable, but the film is often more confusing that it need be.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't already an art film or Wong Kar-Wai fan. It wasn't bad, and I don't regret having watched it. But, unlike the best of art films, I didn't really feel I got much out of it. Even the history that comes out is only understandable if you sift through the extra features on the DVD (which is particularly good at explaining the music).</p>
80189|kikujirononatsu|DVD at home|2002-04-01|<p>I honestly didn't know much of anything about this film when we stuck it in the rental queue. Toshiko had been looking for some Japanese movies, and this was the first one I found which was relatively recent and not some gangster film.</p><p>Masao has just started summer vacation, and he doesn't have anything to do. His grandmother is away at work all day, and his only friend has gone away for the summer. He comes across the address of his mother, who he has never seen, and decides to set off to see her. A friend of his grandmother comes across his as he is being bullied for the little money he has, and sends her husband, Kikujiro, off with him to see his mother (this is in Toyohashi, and they are starting in Tokyo, which isn't exactly close). Kikujiro isn't exactly the ideal chaperone, being a wanna-be thug with little to no human interaction skills.</p><p>Beat Takeshi can only play one character, and can only tell one joke. If you like that character and that joke, you can enjoy his films. For me, I  enjoyed watching <strong>Hanabi</strong>, which was the first film of his I saw. When I saw <strong>Sonatine</strong>, I was not impressed and felt that I'd essentially already seen the movie. This movie is a bit different, since the character he is playing isn't a proficient thug, but a fairly unskilled one. The attitude and language, as well as the body movement, are still the same. And the joke is really about seeing someone bullied or hurt. In this movie it ends up being Beat himself sometimes, but it is still all the same joke told over and over to 2 hours.</p><p>That said, I actually enjoyed this film. The thing about Beat's one joke is that he has many different ways to tell it. The story is an interesting one, although in the end we never get Masao's situation fully explained. It has something of a happy ending, but Masao is essentially a tragic figure and the movie just never elaborates on it through to the end.</p><p>If you've never seen a Beat Takeshi film, this is probably a good one. It is a comedy that's more touching than violent. Of course, if you are into the violence which is Beat Takeshi's hallmark, then you'd be better off with one of his other films, though you'll still enjoy this one if you are a fan. Alas, I am not, and I don't really plan to see any more of his films.</p>
80190|mallrats|DVD at home|2002-04-05|<p>This was the last of the Kevin Smith movies I had not seen. I'd been meaning to see it for a while, but just never got around to it. It hit my radar before it was released, but I guess because I didn't hear any good words about it (and perhaps I was in Japan when it was actually released), so I didn't see it.</p><p>T.S. has just broken up with his girlfriend, while Brodie's girlfriend just left him. To console one another, Brodie takes them to the mall. There, they find a game show setting up for the evening, and then soon find out that T.S.'s girlfriend is going to be the contestant on the dating game, and so set off to sabotage the show. Jay and Silent Bob step in to help out, though what their help is worth is always interesting to see.</p><p>In my opinion, this is the worst of Kevin Smith's movies. This doesn't mean I hated it, just that it didn't measure up to the other movies he has done. I laughed a lot, and the whole segment with Stan Lee was classic. The problem is partly with some of the acting, and ultimately with the script and flow of the movie. As I watched some of the extras, I could see better why things turned out the way they did, with the studio forcing important changes after filming. But the original premises of the film seemed to be rather weak as well.</p><p>I'm glad to have finally seen the complete New Jersey \"Trilogy,\" and would recommend that other people see the movies as well, probably in order just to observe the evolution and repetition of characters. And any fan of comic books will appreciate several aspects of the movie.</p><p>This gets a qualified recommendation. If you don't know the work of Kevin Smith, don't start here. But if you like his style of humor, you'll enjoy seeing this film once.</p>
80191|songcatcher|DVD at home|2002-04-07|<p>It was the music of this film that attracted me. When I heard about the plot, it didn't strike me as interesting, though probably decent. Although certainly riding on the coattails of <short=\"obwat\" title=\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>, it also appears to be independently created (i.e. not in response to the aforementioned movie, but concurrent with).</p><p>Dr. Lily Penleric, after being rejected for tenure, decided to spend the summer with her sister in the southern mountains. Once there, she discovers that the English folk songs that she studies are alive and well in the backwoods of America. She begins writing them down, traveling around the mountain. At the same time, she comes up against the conflict of exploiting these people as the coal and lumber companies are.</p><p>The music of this film is, of course, wonderful. The plot turns out to be interesting and involving, and although at first the protagonist is not very likable (she's so hopelessly academic and insensitive), she is able to change throughout the film in a realistic way that softens her up. Many of the people around her are believable and interesting characters.</p><p>The film falls short with some odd plot twists and bad characterizations. You have people who are just asshole throughout, but don't seem to fit in to the whole mix in a realistic manner. Some of the plot twists seem a bit contrived and some most certainly out of place.</p><p>I enjoyed the film. It is a romance and a drama of discovery, and although not the top of the line when it comes to filmmaking, recommendable to a lot of people, and most certainly to people who enjoy folk music. It does try  to bring up questions about our relationship to folk music, and that is a respectable thing to attempt.</p>
80192|soongsisters|DVD at home|2002-04-08|<p>I think I first heard of this movie while browsing the new DVDs on the shelf at the video store. After reading the description, it sounded like it would be a pretty good movie, particularly given who the main actresses were. It  took me a while, but I finally got a chance to see it</p><p>The three Soong sisters are sent to the United States at an early age so that they can grow up to be the women of China's future (probably circa 1900). The oldest sister marries one of the wealthiest men in China. The second sister marries Sun Yat-Sen. The youngest sister marries Chiang Kai-Shek. So, as you can seen, these are the heavy-hitters of Chinese high society during the early part of the 20th century. We follow their lives, intertwined with the history of China up to 1949, particularly focusing on Madame Sun Yat-Sen.</p><p>There was no doubt going into this that the acting was going to be wonderful. I was particularly impressed with Chiang Kai-Shek. The film itself is quite gorgeous and a pleasure to watch.</p><p>One drawback of the film is that the history isn't timelined well enough. Of course, for the primary audience, they are going to know it, but even for me, having studied the history, I couldn't remember exact dates and was not quite sure what was happening when some times. Things like the Northern Expedition and the murder of the workers in Shanghai are briefly mentioned, and mentioned in such a way that they seem to be marking time for the movie, but the exact year isn't put on too many of the scenes.</p><p>The other drawback of the film is that it really is hero worship. Although I'm certain many of the scenes are fairly legitimate, I felt that Madame Sun was probably exaggerated the most in her importance. Some of the scenes are just too blatantly contrived as well. In the end, I was surprised at how sympathetic the film was the mainland China, though the films 1997 release may provide some insight here. The fact is, Chiang Kai-Shek was an asshole and was responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of people, particularly workers.</p><p>I'd recommend the film to people who enjoy good historical drama. There are a lot of little bonuses in the film for anyone who has studied Chinese history. For other people, the film is interesting to watch, but may leave you a bit confused.</p>
80193|discreetcharm|DVD at home|2002-04-16|<p>I had myself a long movie hiatus, being out of town for a while. I started to watch this before I left, but couldn't finish it, so I watched it yesterday, after coming back early. I didn't really know much about the film beforehand, simply that it was directed by Bu&#241;uel, about whom I've heard good things.</p><p>A group of upper-class \"friends\" attempt to assemble for a dinner party. Among the group is a diplomat from a Latin American country. They all are involved in cocaine in some way. Enter a number of other characters, from the monsignor who takes the gardening job, to the military, and everyone represents some sector of society. Most of their attempts to have a dinner party fail, to reconvene later.</p><p>This is a very hard movie to watch if you aren't committed to it. Things start off very slowly, and never get to a quick pace. The correlations between individuals and the social entities they represent don't become clear until later. The messages end up being interesting, but the movie is too abstract and inaccessible for most. I won't claim to have fully comprehended it myself. On the plus side, if you have completed a quarter or two of college level French, you will probably understand the bulk of the movie without subtitles, since most of the conversation is idle back-and-forth conversation.</p><p>I cannot give this movie a recommendation. I'm not sorry I watched it, and I still want to see another of the director's films, but I'm not sure what the average Joe can get out of it.</p>
80194|bichunmoo|DVD at home|2002-04-19|<p>Here's yet another movie that I didn't know anything about coming into it. The short description claimed that it was the most expensive movie ever produced in South Korea, but I'm not sure if it still holds that distinction. In any case, it guaranteed to combined swordplay with romance, which never sounds too bad to me.</p><p>Yu Jinha and Sullie grow up together, and are certainly destined to grow old together. That is, until her parents come in and decide she needs to marry someone else. After thinking her true love dead, Sullie marries another. 10 years later, Jinha returns to reclaim his love and finds her with a young boy. Intrigue continues as the forces of China battle each other with their masterful sword techniques.</p><p>Plotwise, things get a bit screwy at points and aren't so easy to follow at the transitions. Then there is the fact that for most of the movie people just don't seem to die... well, the protagonists anyway, who seem to arise from the dead just a few times too many.</p><p>On the plus side, the swordfighting is quite fun. The camerawork on it leaves a bit to be desired at times, with the camera too close or too choppy in the edit to be able to follow the fight clearly. Another plus is the gorgeous Sullie.</p><p>The movie is quite fun. It isn't the best South Korean films I've ever seen, but if you already like the swordfighting genre from Hong Kong films, it can be interesting to see the Korean take on things.</p>
80195|scorpionking|United Artists Theater in Marina Del Rey|2002-04-20|<p>I knew what to expect going in to this film. I knew that we'd have The Rock, and although I don't watch pro wrestling on any consistent basis anymore, I still appreciated it and the characters involved. Besides, I've seen The Rock in non-wrestling media a couple times before and liked his style. Then you have the fact that this is a sword and sorcery film. They disappeared for a long time, but is looking to make a comeback. And the final thing I expected was Kelly Hu, and lots of her. I didn't watch <strong>Martial Law</strong> for Sammo Hung alone, I have to admit.</p><p>As the Scorpion King takes over more and more territory, the number of free tribes has been reduced to just a few. Banding together, they hire a group of Akkadians to assassinate the king's sorcerer, Cassandra, who is said to be the key to his power. As our (anti-?)hero, Mathayus, storms the castle, he ends up having to escape but manages to take the beautiful sorcerer with him. He plans to use her to kill king Memnon, but in the meantime finds that she isn't the evil beast everyone has made her out to be.</p><p>I was pleased with this movie. It is over the top and does not have any pretension of being anything more than it is. Don't watch this for complex plot twists or groundbreaking character development. Watch it because you like watching people fight with swords, fists and anything else that comes handy. Watch it because a half-naked Kelly Hu is just absolutely delicious.</p><p>Art house movie this is not, just good, not-so-clean brawling (actually, there isn't any blood in the film). Fun for anyone who doesn't take all of their movies seriously.</p>
80196|rififi|DVD at home|2002-04-20|<p>I had heard the name of this movie some time ago, but kept forgetting about it. Recently, a coworker was talking about it, and described it as \"the heist movie\" that everyone imitated. Then I found out some details, like the attempt (or was it successful for a while?) to ban the movie for a while because it was seen as a textbook on how to rob. I wanted to see it because it was a classic.</p><p>Tony has recently gotten out of jail for a 5 year sentence, and although he would like to stay clean, the offer quickly comes along to do a job. When it is clear that he needs the money, he quickly puts his skills to work. The four men begin preparation for a jewel heist, but they have other problems to deal with. And once they get the jewels in their hands, enjoying the benefits of their labor is another issue.</p><p>This is an excellent movie. Since this is the first and the one from which all later heist movies emulated, you are going to recognize a lot of the basic plot elements and character types. But there is a good reason why this movie was emulated. The actors do an excellent jobs, and cinematically it is beautiful to watch.</p><p>If you get this movie from the DVD, you should watch the interview with the director as well. He was blacklisted, and this was the first film he was able to make after that happened. He relates how the powerful hand of Hollywood kept stepping in to keep him unemployed. He also explains the film, including a few parts that are allegories of the blacklist and HUAC.</p><p>I recommend this film to anyone. There is an amazing 30-minute segment of the movie that contains no dialogue, and it still holds your attention. It is definitely worth catching.</p>
80197|attackthegasstation|DVD at home|2002-04-26|<p>This is my second time watching this <short=\"attackthegasstation\">movie</a>. I liked it so much the first time that I decided to buy it. I think that should pretty much sum up my evaluation of the film. A quite funny movie with characters you can get into. Some insights into Korean society, too, I'm sure. See it!</p>
80198|nomansland|DVD at home|2002-04-26|<p>I had wanted to see this film when I heard about it, but never got people who wanted to go see it with me, so I put it off. I was happy to see that it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film this year, thus boosting my desire to get hold of the movie once it was out on DVD. Friday was a lazy day for me, having just gotten back from a trip to New York, so I had time to watch a movie in the early afternoon after getting back from work early.</p><p>Chiki and Cera are Bosnians who get lost on their way to fight at the front during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Lost in the fog, they end up between enemy lines when the sun comes up and are able to make it to a trench in no man's land. Nino, a Serbian, is sent down to see if there are any survivors. They both end up stuck in the trench, awaiting some way out of their situation.</p><p>This is a pretty good movie. The characters are interesting, if not quite likable, and you get insight into who they are and where they come from. Overall, the film is allegorical, and you see a perspective on who the different parties are and why they act the way the do. Because the film shoots a bit for realism, don't expect a happy ending.</p><p>I recommend the film, and don't think you have to know all that much about the particular conflict in order to follow and understand things. It is fairly universal in its theme, and thus accessible to most. Not your eye candy movie, but one to make you think.</p>
80199|fullmetaljacket|DVD at home|2002-04-27|<p>This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I waited quite a while to purchase it, because I had heard very bad things about the initial releases of Kubrick's films following his death. They remastered the film and re-released it on DVD a while back, and I got word that as long as Kubrick's wife (and family?) held the rights, then they weren't going to do anything more with the film. That was enough for me to make the purchase, instead of holding out for something that may never exist.</p><p>The movie follows Joker, from Paris Island to Viet Nam. The first half of the film depicts boot camp in the late sixties, with the hard-core drill sergeant who provides many of the memorable lines of the film. Of particular note is Pyle, an overweight fellow who isn't the brightest bulb, who gets harassed more than anyone else because he is constantly screwing up. The second half of the film deals with Joker's experiences in Viet Nam, where he is a reporter for Stars and Stripes.</p><p>This film is chocked full of powerful scenes that can move you to tears at times. To boot, there are many genuinely funny lines and a lot of contrast and irony to bring the different issues to light. This film has a bit of everything, and quite a few of your jock types will enjoy it without paying attention to the messages that are coming at you.</p><p>The acting is wonderful all around, and the camerawork is excellent. The different scenes each have their purpose in blending together a larger picture of what it was like to grow up and live through the times. In the end, you have a picture of who was sent to fight in Viet Nam, and a little bit of who the Vietnamese people were and why they won the war.</p><p>I recommend this film to everyone, unconditionally. There are a few graphic scenes, but nothing that anyone should shy away from. If you haven't seen it, feel free to come over to my place... I'll try not to say the script aloud as the film rolls.</p>
80200|friend|DVD at home|2002-04-28|<p>I heard of this film some time ago, in particular because it currently holds the record in South Korea for ticket sales. I kept my eye open, hoping it would be shown somewhere or come up at a video store, but I eventually broke down and bought it. I figured if it broke the record, it couldn't be half bad.</p><p>For friends grow up in the Seventies in Pusan. The narration is from the perspective of Sang-Taek. As they age, their paths diverge but they remain in contact with one another. By 1982, when Sang-Taek and Joong-Ho return from college to visit the other two, Joon-Suk is in jail and Dong-Su is addicted to drugs. Both have entered the world of organized crime. They both clean themselves up, but their world is not one where friendship always holds true.</p><p>The film is beautiful to watch. Although at times the plot jumps a bit, it is fairly easy to follow what is going on. The film is essentially a gangster film, with the narrator and the fourth friend taking a back seat in most of the movie.</p><p>I would recommend the film to those who enjoy gangster films. The interplay of friendship is interesting and enjoyable, but the violence of the gangster world is firmly imprinted on the film and certainly the basis of the films popularity. I will likely watch the film again in the future and am not disappointed that I bought it.</p>
80201|marathonman|DVD at home|2002-04-29|<p>I never really heard of this film until someone at work mentioned it during lunch. They noted in particular how horrific the dental scene was. It got me interested, and I stuck it in my queue. Since my hopes at playing some D&amp;D last night were dashed, I watched this movie instead.</p><p>Babe is a graduate student at Columbia, studying the history of tyranny in  U.S. politics. His older brother is an agent for \"the Division,\" which apparently tracks down escaped Nazis. Szell is one of those escaped Nazis, who has a stash of loot in a safe-deposit box in New York city. When his brother dies, he panics and comes to New York to retrieve his cache of wealth.</p><p>This is a pretty good movie. My main complaint is that there are a few things at the beginning of the film that are unnecessarily confusing. In particular, the scenes switch from New York to France without warning. Otherwise, things fit together nicely. In particular, I like the scene near the end when Szell is in the Jewish jewelry district.</p><p>This film is worth seeing. An above-average film that keeps you wondering about a few things and has an enjoyable ending sequence.</p>
80202|hudsonhawk|DVD at home|2002-05-02|<p>I saw this movie in high school with a friend. We rented it on tape, despite all the bad reviews it got. We were not disappointed, and even adopted <strong>Swinging on a Star</strong> (although the Sinatra version) as our unofficial theme song while engaging in the various mischievous acts that made up our high school evenings. Recently, my roommate bought the DVD, but we had to wait until everyone had the time to sit down and watch it together.</p><p>The Hudson Hawk has just gotten out of prison, and his parole officer wants him to burgle an auction house. Despite his desire to go straight, some very powerful people make it clear that he is going to have to do the job. It winds up sending him to Rome, as the Mayflowers attempt to reassemble an alchemal machine hidden away by DaVinci.</p><p>This is a wonderful movie, which was unfortunately billed as an action film when it was released. It is in fact a comedy, an over-the-top spoof on the genre. The sound effects and the situations do everything they reasonably can to point this out. The acting, often criticized, it highly appropriate and well done by all.</p><p>I highly recommend this film, and it seems likely that I may buy a copy of my own in the future when I finally move. There are lines in this movie worth memorizing.</p>
80203|bighit|Video at home|2002-05-03|<p>This isn't the first time I've watched this <short=\"bighit\">film</a>, and it certainly won't be the last. I love this film. It isn't a movie to be taken seriously, but the plot and action just go together nicely. Of course, China Chow will always keep me coming back for more.</p>
80204|spiderman|AMC 14 Theaters, Century City|2002-05-04|<p>There was never any question of whether I would see this movie or not. I didn't really witness much of the hype, and don't think I saw any of the trailers. I liked Spider-Man a lot as a kid, I remember that one of my favorite toys and TV shows was the web-head. My like of comic books couldn't hurt either.</p><p>Peter Parker is a high school loser, smart and not liked by much of anyone. Like all us suckers, he has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane. Then, on a field trip he gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider. This, needless to say, changes everything. But Peter doesn't do anything with his powers, and after failing to stop a thief, find out that the very thief kills his Uncle Ben. That's when the necessity of him taking a more active role with his skills hits home.</p><p>I didn't have my expectations too high going in, but I certainly expected good work from Sam Raimi and have not been disappointed with Tobey Maguire's acting in the past. I knew going in that the plot was going to diverge from the traditional comic book origin story, and in fact expected as much since anything else would get rather boring. Sam and company did an excellent job. The CGI on Spider-Man is amazingly fluid, and there are very few places in the movie when you can really see that things are computer generated. The story line is solid, pulling in many old-school comic bookish aspects, but also taking a more mature tack when it is clearly called for.</p><p>I really cannot think of any complaints about this movie. I'm certain that it will join my DVD collection when it is released. It also does an excellent job of setting up the sequels, which we all know are coming (didn't this movie just break box-office opening weekend records?). I'm looking forward to seeing it again, and have even contemplated joining other friends when they go to see it later.</p><p>Obviously, this movie gets the big thumbs up. It is enjoyable for everyone, of all ages. Statistics show that most of you have probably already seen the movie, but for those true-believers out there who haven't made it yet, get going.</p>
80205|pitchblack|DVD at home|2002-05-04|<p>I had never heard of Vin Diesel until people at work started talking about him. They said that he played a particular kind of action role, and that he was worth checking out. So, I set out to watch the one movie I could remember them suggesting.</p><p>A space ship is traveling through space and gets thrown off course, crash landing on an unknown planet. Besides the usual travelers on board, there is also a prisoner who is being transported, Riddick. They soon find out that they are not alone on the planet. Also, they figure out that they are soon going to be in total darkness, which the natives of the planet benefit from.</p><p>I really enjoyed this movie. The character Riddick is pretty cool, the anti-hero we all love. Radha Mitchell is also a beauty, whose character is equally appealing. The action and plot flow smoothly and draw you in. The suspense is built well.</p><p>I definitely recommend this movie. I'm sure that I will be interested in watching it again in the future, and found it to be an excellent introduction to Vin Diesel as an actor.</p>
80206|drno|DVD at home|2002-05-05|<p>My roommate actually got the idea of watching all the Bond films about three hours before I did, following my signing up for <a href=\"http://www.netflix.com\" title=\"Netflix\">Netflix</a>. Unfortunately, they ended up getting pushed down the queue while other movies came to our attention. But this is the first one. The down side is that it looks like the other ones may not be coming in so quickly.</p><p>After contact is lost with an agent in Jamaica, James Bond is sent to find out what happened to him. Clues are sparse, and there are plenty of people who are determined to prevent Bond from finding out anything. But the signs all start to point to a Dr. No, who owns an island nearby.</p><p>The movie is quite good, and it was very nice to see the first Bond film. I know that I've seen various films on TV growing up as a kid, but I was never sure which ones. The film has to be filtered through the fact that it was filmed in 1962, but still holds together well. My only real complaint with the film is derived from when it was filmed, namely that two of the roles in the film which are supposed to be Chinese (or half-Chinese at least) are done by white actors. This is a forgivable sin, because Hollywood is always backwards and that was a time when society in general still didn't have its act together (not that it does yet, either).</p><p>If you're a James Bond film, this movie is essential. There's no Q, but all the other elements are there, and in my opinion, Sean Connery is still the best Bond there has been.</p>
80207|help|DVD at home|2002-05-05|<p>I hadn't been to Vidiots in a very long time. It wasn't until I got my receipt that I realized how long... over 2 years. This is a specialty video store in Santa Monica, where I bought a membership some time ago. But because of living circumstances, it wasn't really convenient any longer to rent stuff from there. So yesterday I stopped in to add a friend to my account, since he's more likely to be able to make it there. I figured I ought to rent something, so I ended up with this movie, since the name sounded familiar.</p><p>Joe, Jim and Yan are all doctors at an not so respectable hospital. The extreme lack of concern by all the staff comes to a head when the donor the hospital is named after comes in after being struck by lightning. He is efficiently passed along until no one ends up helping him at all. So, our three doctors set about to reform the hospital with the donor's support. Of course, their ideas of how to go about this aren't exactly sensible, but this movie is supposed to be a comedy (I think).</p><p>Well, I guess I'd seen too many good movies this weekend, so it had to come to an end. The movie isn't unbearable, I mean Cecilia is rather attractive after all, but I cannot say I'd want to sit through this kind of movie again. The plot jumps around and doesn't maintain much focus, and the characters aren't all that endearing. The comedy comes across at times, but many times it seems like things are funny for unintentional reasons. Fortunately, at the end they do wrap things up nicely, making it clear how far-fetched the film has been.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. I wasn't tearing my eyes out (I finished the movie, didn't I), but it isn't something anyone I care about  should have to sit through.</p>
80208|sgtkabukiman|DVD at home|2002-05-10|<p>I'd heard about this movie quite a long time ago, but was just never able to get my hands on it. I'm not a big <a href=\"http://www.troma.com\" title=\"Troma Films\">Troma</a> fan, although I can appreciate the work that they do. I have fond memories of <strong>The Toxic Avenger</strong>, and there is another film about aliens and Las Vegas that I still want to get my hands on. In any case, I mentioned the film a while back and provoked a co-worker into renting the film, so I felt I ought to watch it as well, finally.</p><p>Sgt. Griswold attends an amateur Kabuki play (The Odd Couple) in following up on the death of some Japanese fellow. The play turns into mayhem, but before it is over, the spirit of Kabukiman is transferred to Harold. Back at the department, he is taken off the case, and it is clear that some very powerful forces are working to keep anything more from being found out. Meanwhile, the granddaughter of the man who gave Harry his strange new powers works with him to understand and use his powers to prevent the Evil One from returning and destroying the earth.</p><p>This is a Troma film. If you have never seen one, the aforementioned film is probably the best one. This one is pretty high up on the list as far as quality goes (which Troma is NOT known for). If you don't know what a Troma film is, then let me explain. Take your average B movie. Now push it over the top and give it a slightly worse budget. Now make it a tradition. Troma aren't there for the serious movie-goer, but for the teenage video-watcher who wants a few breast shots, plenty of gore, and isn't worried about the story making sense or the actors being any good.</p><p>That being said, the movie is quite fun. It wears on at times, but you often get a feel that the actors know their place in the grand scheme of movies. Susan Byun, who plays a Japanese(-American?) but I'm sure is actually a Korean-American, is a pleasure to look at. The various tricks which Kabukiman pulls off are generally fun to watch as well.</p><p>I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this film to anyone who doesn't know what they are getting into. If you like Troma films, then you'll definitely like this one. Otherwise, steer clear, many people would consider it a waste of time.</p>
80209|gunmen|DVD at home|2002-05-11|<p>I didn't know anything about this movie before it showed up in my mailbox. I can only guess that it got into my queue because it was produced by Tsui Hark. That's generally a good sign (though not always).</p><p>Chun-Bee get out of the military following the civil war (1910's) and settles in Shanghai, where he becomes a cop. His relationship with his wife isn't the best, and his daughter, who grew up while he was in the army, still won't call him \"papa.. He is working the vice squad, busting up the opium trade, when his captain is killed. He is then pulled off the case, and a new chief is brought into the department to supposedly remove corruption in the force.</p><p>This is a fairly good action film. It has about as happy of an ending as one might expect for this genre of films, and the story along the way is interesting for the most part. It does get hard to follow at times, and there could be more character development and build-up of plot elements to really flesh the movie out. The action and gun fights are nice, although I was struck at times by how anachronistic they felt (I'm not sure if it was the infinite bullets in revolvers or just the general style that I associate with modern Hong Kong gun ballets).</p><p>I'd recommend this film to a Hong Kong action film fan. It is a pretty good film, with good staff behind the camera, and so you won't feel like you've wasted your time.</p>
80210|donniedarko|DVD at home|2002-05-12|<p>I heard the name of this film when it was playing the in the theaters, but never saw a preview or heard anything else about it. A co-worker was telling me about it recently, and he gave it rave reviews. It sounded pretty interesting, in not for any reason other than it was hard to describe.</p><p>Donnie Dark is a 16 year old in Middlesex who has sleepwalking and psychological problems. He is also being spoken to by a time-traveling rabbit, who manages to lure him out of the home on the night that a stray jet engine crashes through his bedroom. As the month of October, 1988, passes, he slowly begins to understand the world around him a little better at the same time that things seem to be falling apart.</p><p>This is one of those quirky films that will always be hard to explain to someone who hasn't seen it. Another film like that is <strong>Brazil</strong>, which is a wonderful film, but a basic explanation of the film doesn't make a lot of sense to your average listener. The acting is superb and the plot is a wonderful trip to follow. The film is also quite funny, and typically from insightful and well set-up jokes.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film to everyone. The DVD is also nice, with some interesting extras which are either funny or help tie the film together better.</p>
80211|ferrisbueller|Video at home|2002-05-14|<p>One of the great classic films that forms a part of my youth, this movie needs to be watched again every so often. I got home really early last night, and the roommates were in the mood to watch something. I'd gotten some elements of the film into my head recently, so I suggested watching it.</p><p>Ferris wakes up on a nice day and realizes that he just should be bothered with high school today. He fakes illness to his parents, and then gathers his best friend and girlfriend for a fun-filled day in the city of Chicago. It doesn't hurt that they start of by borrowing Cameron's father's Ferrari.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with this film at all. If there is, I wouldn't notice it anyway. It's a great comedy, and Ferris and the people around him are likable characters. The situations that arise are all slightly absurd, but work quite well to pull the film together. There's also the fact that it was shot in the city of Chicago, so it brings back pleasant memories for me there (although I guess the fact that their travels in the city don't follow any coherent geographic patter, but like I said, I don't care).</p><p>One of the greatest films of the eighties, this is necessary viewing for anyone who wants to understand American culture. It is timeless in many ways,  and should appeal to everyone.</p>
80212|mrdeedsgoestotown|DVD at home|2002-05-17|<p>The only reason I ever heard of this movie is because I read a preview of the upcoming Adam Sandler film, <short=\"mrdeeds\" title=\"Mr. Deeds\">Mr. Deeds</a>. I don't know much about old movies, so it is rare that I catch any of them. This seemed to have good reviews, though, so it seemed worth checking out.</p><p>Longfellow Deeds, a tuba player in a small isolated town, inherits $20 million (which in 1936, makes him one of the richest men in the country). He moves to New York to take up his uncle's place, and quickly finds that everyone is out to cheat him. He's an honest guy, and falls for the damsel in distress who is actually an undercover reporter for the local papers.</p><p>This movie was wonderful. It has some basic elements that require a suspension of disbelief, but then builds everything solid around that. The film is very humorous, and Gary Cooper does a wonderful job of portraying the brutally honest and naive Mr. Deeds. The people around his are also excellent, in particular the reporter and his frog-voiced assistant.</p><p>I recommend this movie to everyone. It is funny and touching, although some might find it cheesey. I'd be happy to watch it again sometime, and am looking forward to Sandler's interpretation.</p>
80213|episode2|The Bridge, Howard Hughes Plaza|2002-05-18|<p>What kind of introduction does this movie need. The biggest debate was when I'd go see it. It certainly wasn't worth making a special effort to see it on opening day. And then there is the temptation to wait a week so that you don't contribute to the \"opening weekend\" of the movie, as punishment for the previous installment. But alas, with little to do this weekend except punish myself by going to car dealerships, my roommates and I went to see it during the matinee.</p><p>Anakin Skywalker is 22, and has the last 10 years training to become a Jedi knight. When the life of Senator Amidalla is threatened, he is assigned to protect her life. Meanwhile, a separatist movement is threatening to break up the republic, and many people are proposing to create an army to deal with the situation. Of course, as the investigation into who is trying to kill Amidalla unfolds, we find out that an army is already being created, a clone army.</p><p>I was overall pleased with the film. It will certainly spawn workplace discussions this week, particularly as to its merits and its consistencies (or lack thereof). Many of the downright repulsive elements of <strong>Episode I</strong> are missing, or used in such a way to begin to redeem themselves. The acting isn't very good, but the subtle elements of the film are nice and involving. And hey, who would complain about Natalie Portman?</p><p>There's no need to recommend this film. If you want to see it, you don't need my advice. I'll be there when <strong>Episode III</strong> is out, though not the first night, because <strong>Star Wars</strong> is too important a  part of my childhood to abandon now.</p>
80214|trainingday|DVD at home|2002-05-22|<p>I had wanted to see this movie when it was in the theaters, but never made it. I have a friend who lives in one of the movie locations (\"the jungle\"), and they had filmed it just around the corner from his place. That's how the movie first came to my attention. And hey, Denzel won the best actor Oscar for his performance, so I already knew the quality was going to be good.</p><p>Jake wakes up to his first day in an elite narcotics squad on the LAPD. He has to meet his training officer and commander, Alonzo, at a diner in the morning. Alonzo quickly sets about showing Jake the ropes, and they aren't pretty. He introduced Jake to the harder side of the streets, and the difficulties of being undercover. But Jake is never sure whether Alonzo is on the up-and-up.</p><p>The movie was indeed wonderful. The acting was very convincing all around, and you never get a sense that Alonzo is a straight bad guy (which he isn't), but instead someone who really believes what they are saying. The films keeps you guessing, keeps you on your toes, and doesn't disappoint. I think it does an excellent job of getting you to think about the issues it addresses, which is something many movies aren't very good at.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film to everyone. It is unfortunate that I didn't get to see it in the theaters, but the \"making of\" documentary on the DVD gave me some information that I would have missed otherwise. Definitely a night well spent.</p>
80215|eroticghosts|Video at home|2002-05-23|<p>I've only seen one other category III film, and it was the infamous <strong>Sex and Zen</strong>. It wasn't particularly good, or at least, I cannot really remember much about it. This is the other category III film I'd heard enough about to think that it merited watching. Oh, for those of you who aren't familiar with Hong Kong ratings, category III is usually equivalent to U.S. Rated R, soft-core porn. Violence in Hong Kong films doesn't lower a rating the way that nudity does. Also, cat III films have a reputation for being pretty low quality.</p><p>Three sisters, all fox spirits, are close to becoming actual humans (or immortal versions of them, anyway). The one trick. They have to remain moral or they will be forever turned back into foxes. Then along comes an innocent looking scholar, who manages to tempt each sister in turn. When the sisters begin to turn back into foxes, they can only remedy this by uncovering the scholar's secret.</p><p>The film is quite funny. The plot is only slightly more intricate than an American porn (or at least, as I remember them from high school). The special effects would make a 1970s film look cutting edge. The few attempts at fighting are laughable, but quick. In fact, this movie sports the shortest final fight scene in movie history, I'm sure of it. And to top it all off, I accidentally rented a dubbed version.</p><p>So could I recommend the film. I guess so, as long as you know what you are getting into. Watch this because it is funny, in a B-movie sort of way. Some of the humor is on purpose, but much of it isn't. I'd never watch the film again, but at least now I know... and knowing is half the battle.</p>
80216|needingyou|DVD at home|2002-05-23|<p>This movie came to my attention because I was reading a lot of movie reviews of recent Hong Kong films, and a major complaint was that most of the romantic comedies were simply imitations of the successful formula of this film. Add on top of that the fact that Sammi Cheng is the main actress, and there wasn't much convincing that needed to be done. A lot of the other staff in front of and behind the camera are building blocks to a good movie.</p><p>Kinki is transferred under Andy's department at a time when she is having relationship problems. Andy isn't a stellar performer either, relying on prostitutes most of the time. Kinki proves her effectiveness on the job, but rumors begin to fly about the relationship between the two. They are both, of course, in denial, as Andy is being solicited by an ex-lover and Kinki gets courted by a start-up billionaire.</p><p>The plot elements of the film are quite predictable, and there are few surprises along the way, but the film is still enjoyable. The elements of exaggeration (necessary in Hong Kong) are a bit annoying at times, since they seem so unnatural. For example, Kinki's habit of cleaning when she is upset. The exageration of her family, though, really works to highlight how depraved male-female relationships are: not only in Hong Kong, but in general.</p><p>The film is fun, and if you are open to Hong Kong romantic comedies, this is probably one of the better ones to try. The subtitles can go a little fast at times, but the characters are a pleasure to watch.</p>
80217|tokyoraiders|DVD at home|2002-05-24|<p>I'm not sure how this movie got to me. It must have been referenced somewhere and I just stuck it in my movie queue. It had a lot of decent people on both sides of the camera, and the story sounded interesting enough.</p><p>Macy gets stood up at the altar by her fiance Takahashi. When she gets back to Hong Kong, the interior decorator, Yung, shows up to get the final payment of his bill. Shortly, they end up in Tokyo looking for her fiance. They get attacked by yakuza, and meet Lin, a private detective hired to uncover Takahashi's affair with the yakuza boss's woman.</p><p>The movie was pretty fun. It was quite interesting to watch, because one of the other people with me speaks Cantonese. So when the Japanese actors would speak bad Cantonese, she would cringe. And when the Cantonese actors would speak bad Japanese, I got my chance to cringe as well. It ends up running rather smooth, though, and Kelly appears to be fluent in both languages. The plot is a little bit complex and hard to follow at times, with twists and turns at unexpected junctures, but then that is what makes it an interesting flick. The fight scenes had some good choreography to boot.</p><p>This wasn't a stunning piece that I'd have to recommend to anyone, but I wouldn't tell you not to see it. If you hear about it and it sounds interesting, you will probably not be disappointed.</p>
80218|manwhowouldbeking|New Beverly Cinema|2002-05-26|<p>I had wanted to catch this movie some time ago, but just never got around to it. A friend pointed out that it was showing at the New Beverly, which runs old and recent films. It being one of my lazy sundays, I couldn't resist setting the time aside (besides, there's a nice Thai restaurant down the street).</p><p>Daniel and Peachy are former British soldiers in India in the 1880s.  Scraping by as con artists, they get the idea to head into Kafiristan, a region north of Afghanistan that has been untouched by Western hands since Alexander the Great. The plan. With 20 rifles and plenty of ammunition, they hope to train an army and conquer the country, setting themselves up as kings. It ends up working out a little better than they expect.</p><p>This is a great film, with a pair of wonderful actors. I haven't read the Kipling book this is based on, and I have no way to gauge how much is fiction writing and how much is historical. But the story is excellent, and the film comes together very well. Much of it is a commentary on power and the actions of governments and men.</p><p>I'd recommend this to anyone who can enjoy a serious film. There are many funny spots, both from jokes and from situations. Definitely worth a watch.</p>
80219|dracula|DVD at home|2002-05-28|<p>\"You like totally killed the vampire, Ted!. I never would have watched this movie again, I had thought, since I couldn't really remember anything about it that I didn't remember from the book. But my roommate is reading the book for class, since the professor recommended that they watch the movie at home to look for certain things. That placed me on the couch, since I had to eat dinner anyway. I cannot say that I stayed awake, though.</p><p>Ted, er, um, Jonathan, is sent to Transylvania to broker a real estate deal with Vlad Tepes, otherwise known as Count Dracula. Jonathan's fiance, Mina,  remains in London, but as she is the reincarnation of Dracula's wife, they have a strong connection. Jonathan gets trapped in the castle while the count makes for London, where he slowly turned Mina's friend Lucy into a vampire and begins to court Mina in his younger, more attractive form. But then Jonathan escapes.</p><p>It is very hard to take this film seriously. Even with his slight attempt to affect an accent, Keanu still comes off as Ted \"Theodore\" Logan. I kept expecting him to lope around like in the other movie. The whole shadow thing gets quite annoying very quickly as well. There were also several places in the film where I was struck by the anachronism of a situation, but I cannot even remember what they were now. I laughed too many times at places which shouldn't have been laughed at. Then, of course, you have the gratuitous use of breasts throughout the film for no really good reason.</p><p>Positive aspects of the movie. Well, I too would come back from the dead if I got to get with Winona. Gary Oldman is always good, especially when he's the \"bad\" guy.. And, the wonderfully symbolic scene from the movie where the three wives are sucking Jonathan's blood, and then to placate them Dracula gives them a baby to suck on. Such is the lot of women in this society.</p><p>I wouldn't put anyone through this film. It isn't the worst film I've ever seen, but I wasn't disappointed when I fell asleep during the thing. If you are into vampires, there are better movies, and at the very least, the book is actually quite good.</p>
80220|cestlavie|DVD at home|2002-05-29|<p>This film probably first entered my radar because of the French title on a Hong Kong film. I wasn't able to confirm one way or the other whether this was a remake of an older film. In any case, it has gotten plenty of good reviews, and I think it won quite a few awards the year it came out.</p><p>Kit leaves his girlfriend, Tracy who is a famous singer, and takes up residence above a family that performs to local crowds, particularly Chinese opera. Min, the daughter, takes a liking to Kit, and their friendship and relationship develops, exploring a side of Kit that he hadn't really exposed before.</p><p>When I watched this film, I didn't know what the catch was. I didn't know and so I was surprised when the film took the turn it did. Even before that happens, the film was already quite good, and the way in which it deals with an issue that is typically not done well is very respectable. This is perhaps the best Hong Kong romances I have seen (although I haven't really seen that many, excluding romantic comedies). The ending isn't exactly happy, but it also isn't as depressing as it may first seem on the surface.</p><p>I most certainly recommend this film. Don't watch it if you are looking to be in a good mood afterwards, but if you want an emotionally moving film, you won't be disappointed.</p>
80221|saltoftheearth|Video at UCLA|2002-05-30|<p>I've seen this movie a few times, but seeing it more will never hurt. It is a classic film that everyone should see. It was banned in the United States. It was made by people who had been blacklisted for refusing to testify in the McCarthy hearings. The lead actress was deported during filming to try to prevent the movie from being made. Needless to say, it had trouble getting distributed. Oh yeah, and the events are based on an actual strike in 1950.</p><p>Ramon Quintero is an outspoken miner in a small Zinc mine in New Mexico. His wife, Esperanza, is pregnant with their third child when the miners decide it is time to strike, following yet another accident caused by the miners being forced to work solo. Of course, it is only the \"Mexican\" miners who face such conditions, although it threatens everyone's life. To boot, they get paid less and live in substandard housing compared to the Anglo miners, who have sanitation and heated water. As the strike drags on, we see how the women and children also suffer. But when an injunction prevents the miners from picketing, it is only by overcoming their differences and prejudices that they are going to be able to win.</p><p>This movie rocks. Except for about 6 or 7 people, the bulk of the cast are actually miners and their wives who participated in the original strike. The story is a dramaticization, written to get the point across, but everything is quite real. It is really a textbook to how a strike can be one, i.e. by spreading the strike and making sure that you cannot be divided. As long as the Anglo miners and the Mexican miners don't have equality, they cannot win. And furthermore, as long as the male miners cannot come to terms with the necessary role their wives play, they will not be able to win. The actions of a few individuals can influence many, and turn a tide when things are at the brink. In addition, this is probably the most progressive film ever made in the United States about women. They are actually human beings with wills and capacities of their own, something that you just don't see on film.</p><p>Everyone should watch this film. Sure, some lame assholes aren't going to understand it, or are going to harp on technical issues while oblivious of the reality behind the movie. But, for everyone else, the movie holds an incredible amount of value, both for the contents and for the circumstances surrounding its creation.</p>
80222|happygilmore|DVD at home|2002-06-01|<p>I'd caught the first few minutes of this film some time ago, and had a fairly favorable impression of it, but just never got around to renting it. It came up among my roommates, and I decided to get ahold of it sooner, rather than later.</p><p>Happy Gilmore wants to play hockey, and he has a pretty strong slap shot. The problem is, he sucks at everything else on the ice. That, and he has a temper that puts him into the penalty box as soon as he hits the ice. When his grandmother gets evicted from her house for failure to pay taxes, he needs to come up with serious money quickly. He's challenged to hit a golf ball, and soon learns that he has an amazing drive. He gets picked up for a pro tour, but things are bound to be rocky, since he don't know the least bit about golf.</p><p>This movie is hilarious, from the early scenes when the Chinese woman knocks on his door, to my favorite scene when Happy and Bob Barker go at it on the green. There are a few points in the movie where the absurdity gets to be too much, or the jokes just don't quite hit the mark. But, for the most part, this film is going to be a solidly pleasurable viewing experience.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film to people. To be honest, I wasn't a fan of Sandler when he was on <strong>SNL</strong>, and I wasn't greatly impressed by some of his movies (<strong>Waterboy</strong>, <strong>Little Nicky</strong> ), but when the movie goes a bit more serious, I like his style and performance.</p>
80223|godofgamblers|Video at home|2002-06-01|<p>It's almost embarrassing that I've never seen this film. Of course, I've only seen a few of Chow Yun-Fat's films. When it came up as a topic of conversation recently with a couple friends, I realized that I should fill in the gaps in my education. I didn't even know the premise of the film beforehand, although I could sort of guess from the various imitations and parodies I have seen.</p><p>Ko Chun is the god of gamblers. But, with a promise to compete against another famous gambler coming up, he tumbles down a cliff and loses his memory, reverting to a child-like state. He comes into the care of a couple of thugs and their hot girlfriend. She prevents them from taking his money, but they do manage to use him to shark some gambling dens throughout town. But when the pieces as to who he really is start to fit together, it can get quite dangerous.</p><p>This is a fun film, although at times the role which Chow is playing can get on one's nerves. Unfortunately, the copy we rented wasn't very good, and apparently, they haven't fixed up this film yet, so there aren't really any quality copies around. The one really cool thing about this film is that Chow doesn't pick up a gun until almost the end of the film, and then it is just for a brief segment. The rest of the time, he is either afraid of them or is the suave type who lets other people use the guns for him.</p><p>Definitely a film worth checking out, if for nothing else just so that you have seen one of the classics of Hong Kong cinema.</p>
80224|brandedtokill|DVD at home|2002-06-03|<p>There was a Suzuki Seijun retrospective at the Nuart several years ago, which brought this director to my attention, but I never managed to actually go see any of the films. Since <a href=\"http://www.criterionco.com\" title=\"Criterion Collection\">Criterion</a> saw fit to put a couple of his movies on DVD, I knew they had to be worth checking out. This was the first one I could get my hands on. Beyond the above, I really didn't know much about what to expect, although I do know that the production company, Nikkatsu, does a lot of pink films now.</p><p>Hanada is a top ranked killer in Japan, but he is not number one. We get a glimpse of his daily life, both at home and at work. But one day his misses his target because a butterfly lands on the barrel of his rifle just as he's about to fire. This spells out his doom, and he is firmly aware at this point that he is marked for death for the \"mistake.\"</p><p>I had a hard time following this movie. The basic plot is relatively easy to follow, but the movie is consciously bizarre. Everything is quite disjointed, in every possible sense. At times you think there is plenty of symbolism, but then you cannot be sure. I cannot say this was a pleasant viewing experience.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Apparently there are some die hard fans of both the director and the lead actor, but from this movie I cannot honestly assess why.</p>
80225|kingofcomedy|DVD at home|2002-06-07|<p>I was looking forward to this film because the synopsis I had read mentioned the pan of John Woo/Chow Yun-Fat movies. That, and the fact that Stephen Chow has just made some great movies. The only downside to his movies is that many of the references are probably lost on foreign audiences. I get a number of the jokes because I've watched so many films, but I'm sure I'm missing  things as well.</p><p>Wan Tin-Sau keeps trying to get into the movies, bugging his aunt to get him onto the set as an extra or anything. Occasionally he gets his chance, but he always screws up. In the meantime, he runs a local rec center. Word of his ability to teach acting for free attracts the hostesses of a nearby club, who need coaching on how to pretend to be virginal college girls. That's how he means Piu-piu. And then the opportunity to star in a film drops in his lap when he somehow wins the eye of a leading actress, Cuckoo.</p><p>The scene which imitates John Woo films is enough reason to see this film. If you've seen only a few of them, you will be rolling on the floor laughing. The rest of the film is pretty good too. My only real complaint is that they do too good of a job making Cecilia look ugly for most of the film.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film. Stephen Chow is a pleasure to watch, and most of his jokes hit when they should.</p>
80226|gotellitonthemountain|Video at friend's house|2002-06-08|<p>A friend and I were at the video store looking for something to rent and watch at his place, and I didn't really have a lot of ideas (and this despite the fact that my movie queue is almost 500 movies long!). The problem was, we wanted something serious. I came across this, and although I have never read any James Baldwin, it seemed like it should be a good movie. Apparently, the movie is based on the autobiographical book of the same title.</p><p>John Grimes, on the cusp of fourteen, is growing up in Harlem sometime in the 20s or 30s (the film doesn't make it clear). His step-father, Gabriel, is a devoutly religious man who is more concerned with discipline for the child than anything else. As event unfold, we learn about Gabriel's past in the south, including the circumstances of his sister fleeing the family for the north and his siring of an illegitimate child with a woman who had been raped by white men and was thus tainted.</p><p>Events of the movie are hard to follow at times, but the pace is so slow that there is plenty of time to catch up. Religion plays a key role in the film, and the piece is mostly thematic. There really isn't a heavy plot, more just issues that come up with time. It seemed to do a good job of depicting the times, both the South of the turn of the century and the period of John's childhood.</p><p>I probably wouldn't recommend the film. Although the film doesn't have a \"religion is the answer\" message so directly, there is so much of it in there that I couldn't help but be turned off. Gabriel is represented quite well, but he is still not a respectable figure in my opinion by the end of the film.</p>
80227|harvey|DVD at home|2002-06-08|<p>This has been on my list of movies to see for a while. I mean, who can resist a movie about a guy who talks to a 6-foot tall rabbit. I've also been wanting to see more of the classic black and white films, and I know that James Stewart is good on screen.</p><p>Elwood P. Dow. is known by everyone in town, probably in part because his family is fairly well off. His sister and niece are having a hard time, however, dealing with the fact that Mr. Dowd talks to a 6 foot rabbit that most other people cannot see. They are drinking buddies, and they spend quite a bit of time down at Charley's. When Elwood disrupts a social gathering that his sister has sponsored for the express purpose of matching up her daughter, she decides to have him committed. That's not as easy as it sounds.</p><p>This is a delightful film whose strongest point seems to be its ability to poke fun at our definitions of sanity and the profession of psychology in general. The doctor doesn't seem to be able to diagnose anyone right, from Elwood and his sister to the attractive nurse who assists him. Although Stewart's portrayal seems to be a bit too much at times, a bit too out of touch, the acting is quite good (Hull won the Oscar that year). And the characters, though a couple are exaggerated at times, are believable.</p><p>This is an excellent story, and it is worth it for anyone to get hold of. The DVD includes an intro by Stewart recorded back in 1990, but isn't worth the extra effort. I'd probably like to watch this film again sometime in the years to come.</p>
80228|uhf|DVD at home|2002-06-09|<p>I was a huge \"Weird Al\" fan growing up. I had all of his albums (tapes, actually, at that time) probably up until the time I left for college. So, needless to say, <strong>UHF</strong> was destined to be a favorite movie from the moment I heard it was coming out. And then a while back I heard that it was coming out on DVD with plenty of cool extras. Now I just have to find the time to watch them all.</p><p>George Newman has a wild imagination, but it only seems to be good for getting him fired and making him late for appointments with his girlfriend. And then his uncle wins a failing UHF station in a poker game and decides to put George in charge. With some creative programming, the station quickly rises to the top, beating out the network affiliate in the ratings. But the uncle's gambling habits force him to put the station up for sale, and the rival owner at Channel 8 wants to buy the station and turn it into a parking lot.</p><p>At this point, some of the jokes are a bit too old, but the movie is still hilarious. It pokes fun at TV and movies from the eighties as well as adding it its own brand of humor. There are lines from this movie that come to  mind quite often, and it was nice to finally fill in my roommate on what we are talking about whenever we buy red snapper.</p><p>I'm looking forward to the commentary track on this disc, and am certain that I won't be disappointed with my purchase. I cannot say the movie is for everyone, but it is worth a look by all. I love it.</p>
80229|metropolis|DVD at home|2002-06-13|<p>I heard about this movie when it played in the art theaters here in Los Angeles, but never got around to seeing it. I honestly didn't know much about it, I was just attracted by the fact that it seemed like a more sophisticated anime and that it was based on Tezuka Osamu (aka the grandfather of manga) work. Got it on DVD without realizing that it was also loosely based on the 1920's German film of the same name, which I actually didn't like.</p><p>Kenichi and his uncle come from Japan to Metropolis to track down and arrest Dr. Laughton, a notorious mad scientist. At the same time, the Ziggurat has been complete, the greatest building on the planet built under the control of the Red Duke. As Kenichi and his uncle close in on the doctor, his lab is destroyed. Kenichi survives the fire with Tima, who no one realizes is a robot. There are competing factions who want to find Tima, though for what end is another question.</p><p>The animation for this movie is absolutely stunning. There are many scenes which will just wow you. In addition, the music is excellent, with a lot of 20's style jazz and a few other tunes that just fit the bill. Unfortunately, that's where my appreciation for the film ends. It isn't horrible, and certainly no where near as bad as the Fritz Lang film, but the story just doesn't do anything for me in the end. I'm not motivated behind any of the characters. The underlying message, as well, is the age-old fear of what technology will do to human kind and \"humanity.. This is a question that the Japanese have learned to obsess over more than anyone, so it isn't exactly a new theme.</p><p>If you are an anime fan, I'm sure you will enjoy this film. For my money, however, there are better things to spend your time watching.</p>
80230|longestnite|Laemmle Sunset 5 Theatre|2002-06-15|<p>The <a href=\"http://www.asianfilm.org\" title=\"Asian Film Foundation\">Asian Film Foundation</a> is showing an Asian film at midnight every two weeks this summer, and this was their opening night. I only recently got into Johnnie To films, but I have to say that none of them have left me disappointed yet. The difficult thing was staying awake long enough on a Friday to watch a midnight movie.</p><p>Tony has just come back into Macau. He's got business to arrange. Sam is a cop, but he's also one of the top men in the triads. The two triads are currently trying to come to an agreement, since an older boss is looking to bring them both under thumb. The only way they can handle this threat is to work together. But then one boss is slain, and a couple more important people come up missing. And tonight at midnight, it will all be resolved.</p><p>This was a great movie, and it shows that there is a niche in Hong Kong that Hollywood can never hope to fill. Neither character is a good guy. You come to know them, to like them, be interested in what is going to happen to them, but you wouldn't ever consider them moral or upright individuals. The plot is also full of twists and turns that keep you on your toes. And the ending comes as a bit of a surprise.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film. I saw it in a theater, and while in line some people were talking about how the version available on video isn't very good at all because the subtitles are so small. That might shy some away, but if you can get a good copy or see it on the big screen, it is worth it.</p>
80231|sunshinestate|Landmark Westside Pavilion Cinemas|2002-06-22|<p>I'm always anxious for a new John Sayles movie, but they almost always sneak up on me. I first heard about this one in a summer movie preview magazine a few months ago, but then could never keep the title in my head to search it out. Luckily, I managed to notice that it was opening this last weekend and made it in.</p><p>Desiree returns to her hometown in Lincoln Beach, Florida, which she had abandoned as a young girl. She has not seen her mother since, and only written occasionally. Marly is running the restaurant and motel that her father owns, since his diabetes keeps him at home. And developers have come into town, looking to buy up property to establish a high-classed resort area on the island that was once the only Black-accessible beach on the East Coast.</p><p>Sayles is always an impressive director, and this is no exception. The story isn't so directly moving or political as some of his other films, but the messages still come across. There are many characters who get thrown at the viewer, but it is very easy to distinguish them and grow to be concerned about their lives (unlike many films which have a heavy cast). The acting, in turn, is also superb. I was struck at the end of the film by the fact that everyone in the film was beautiful, but not in the Hollywood sense of the term.</p><p>Sayles is not a director for everyone, which is why this was shown at an art theater and not in the mainstream cinemas. But, if you can enjoy a movie with realistic characters, realistic situations, and no explosions or swooning love stories, you shouldn't miss this film. It isn't his best, but it still shines bright.</p>
80232|threekings|DVD at home|2002-06-23|<p>When the previews for this movie first came out, it looked quite lame... in part because it was about the Gulf War. But then a friend of mine saw it and told me what it was actually about. I don't remember if I saw it in the theater or shortly after it came out on video, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I put off getting it on DVD because I had trouble verifying if there were different editions out, but finally got it recently.</p><p>After the cease fire of the Gulf War, four soldiers find a map to a bunker containing Kuwaiti gold. Seeing it as the perfect opportunity to make a little extra money, they set off one day to find the bunker. What they find isn't so wonderful, with Iraqi soldiers mobilized against the people who until recently President Bush had been calling on to rise up against Saddam Hussein. And, of course, the U.S. military isn't going to do anything about it (they actually rearmed the Iraqi army so it could do this).</p><p>This is a wonderful movie. It has most of the aspect you would expect from a Hollywood movie, but actually comes through as intellectually stimulating as well. The overall plot is a hero story, but there are so many little details that make the movie quite rich. You see the kinds of jobs they have at home. You see the kinds of attitudes people have. And most importantly, you see a bit of what was going on in Iraq. The interrogation scene is magnificent, from the Michael Jackson question through the revelation of who exactly taught the guy how to torture people.</p><p>This is a must-see film for anyone alive today. It is so very rare that a movie with political substance comes out of Hollywood, so they must be cherished when they do come along.</p>
80233|cgs3|DVD at home|2002-06-24|<p>Well, I saw no reason not to finish off the series. I know that sequels usually aren't worth much, and I didn't expect anything special in this case either. All one really can expect is more of Joey Wong, who plays the role wonderfully.</p><p>Fong, a young monk, and his master are transporting a golden buddha (I cannot remember if there is ever any why to this). They encounter Yin, a swordsman, who took the name from an old man he honered (from the earlier films). And then there is Lotus, the ghost who comes to seduce the monks staying in the old temple so her tree-spirit master can eat their souls, but then turns around and falls for the young monk. The plot is pretty much the same as the first movie, with only Joey returning for the cast.</p><p>The movie is fun, and there are several well placed jokes. Joey is as pleasant as expected. Other than that, there really isn't anything to shout about here. If you've seen the first two movies, and enjoyed them, then you'll probably enjoy this one as well. But it doesn't go on the list of classics as the first one does.</p>
80234|doubletap|DVD at home|2002-06-24|<p>Other than reading a review of the movie at some point which indicated that it was one of the better movies of 2000, I didn't know anything about this film going into it. It wasn't until the movie had started that I figure out exactly what a \"double tap\" was. But, as we all know, it isn't hard to get me to watch a Hong Kong film.</p><p>Rick has retired from sport shooting, although he used to be one of the best. He still modifies guns for other competitors, but that's about it. When a few people are assassinated, the speed of the job leads the police to suspect one of the champion shooters. Miu, who was the last person to compete with Rick, pulls Rick in, but doesn't have anything on him. Sure that he is guilty, Miu then trumps up charges against Rick's girlfriend. Big mistake.</p><p>The movie was quite unexpected. I went in thinking it was going to be an action movie, and it turned to be more of a thriller. I was a little confused even at the end as to what the time frame was for certain sequences, since there is a part of the movie which explicitly says it takes place several years earlier. But, everything still falls into place. The outcome is a little unexpected, though it seemed they could have played up more on some dramatic moments.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to other people. The plot is enjoyable to follow, and doesn't get bogged down.</p>
80235|irongiant|DVD at home|2002-06-29|<p>Although I heard about this film quite a bit, I didn't really know much about the plot going into it. But hey, with the ratings it got, it had to be worth checking out. That, and although I haven't caught more than one of his films to day, I heard that Vin Diesel voiced the giant.</p><p>Shortly after Sputnik has been launched into space, something else crash lands just off the coast of Maine. Everyone assumes the sailor who lost his ship was just drunk, but then the young boy Hogarth Hughes comes upon the iron giant while tracking down what became of his TV antenna. After saving the giant's life, they become friends. But, there is a federal agent in town who is determined to track down the giant and destroy it. Then there is the problem of feeding the new friend, who lives by consuming metal.</p><p>This was an amazingly fun movie. There are little political jabs, although nothing really meaty, and plenty of other humor to keep it lively. The story is geared towards children, but certainly maintains an adult appeal. The art is also quite interesting, showing 1950s influence while taking advantage of modern techniques. And the moral at the end of the story isn't overbearing.</p><p>This is definitely worth a watch for anyone. It isn't deep, introspective cinema, but will certain make for an entertaining evening if you are up for something light.</p>
80236|samehada|Laemmle Sunset 5 Theatre|2002-06-29|<p>Not being all that up on recent Japanese cinema (well, most of it is marginal in Japan as well), I didn't hear about this movie until I saw that it was showing for the <a href=\"http://www.asianfilm.org/events/MAS_051802.html\" title=\"Midnight At sunset\">Midnight @ Sunset</a> series. Reading the description, it sounded like it would be a fun movie. And, hey, I need to practice my Japanese.</p><p>The beautiful but timid Momojiri Toshiko decides to make an escape. She's grown up in this remote mountain town and works at the hotel run by an older man who we soon learn is just a little too obsessed with her. As she flees, she meets up with Samehada, a yakuza who has decided to quit and take off with a bit of cash that Mr. Tanuki thinks belongs to him. Obviously, the yakuza aren't going to let this lie. But, neither is the hotel owner, who hires Yamada to track down Toshiko and bring her back.</p><p>This is a funny movie with a plot that pulls you in and keeps your attention. Every character in the film is unique, loaded with one quirk or another. The main characters are also quite endearing. Samehada has the sensibilities and know-how of a decent yakuza, but the decency of gentleman. And you cannot help but rooting for Toshiko as she breaks out of her shell.</p><p>I would definitely recommend this film to anyone. Its flavor is a bit in the vein of Tarantino, so if you have enjoyed his films, you won't be disappointed here.</p>
80237|ditto|DVD at home|2002-06-30|<p>I've already reviewed this <short=\"ditto\">film</a>. I was in the mood for the movie last night, though I cannot say that watching a somewhat depressing romance is the best thing for those times when you aren't feeling so happy about one's lack of a love life. It is still a great movie.</p>
80238|bourneidentity|Loews Cineplex Beverly Center Cineplex|2002-07-03|<p>I probably would have never seen this film if it hadn't been for other people taking me to see it. I had heard of it, and it looks sorta interesting, but nothing special. I heard many people at work talking about how much they had liked the book when they'd read it oh so many years ago. People seemed to like the movie, though they didn't have anything stellar to report.</p><p>In the seas south are Marseilles, a body is found floating in the water. Still alive, the fellow suffers from amnesia, but also has two bullet wounds in his back and a small device in his hip that contains the information to a bank account in Zurich. Once ashore, he heads to the bank to find out who he is, and opens a deposit box filled with various passports, money, and a gun. But someone spots him at the bank and they are soon trying to take him (alive or dead). Desperate to get to Paris, Jason Bourne (the most common name among the various IDs he finds) gets the assistant of a Cooper-driving European girl.</p><p>Well, the word from my companion who had read that book was that this is a complete re-write. That isn't really a bad thing, just that the movie has very little to do with the book. Overall, it was fun. There are some enjoyable action scenes. The down side is that the whole \"who am I?\" thing gets dragged on way too long. The pieces of this puzzle are just a bit to clear to be surprised when he finds out who he's been working for.</p><p>The movie is fun, and that's about all there is to it. It doesn't have a lot of substance, and wouldn't be at the top of my list of ways to kill times, but you won't want to unwatch it when the credits start rolling.</p>
80239|fightclub|DVD at home|2002-07-04|<p>I've already seen this <short=\"fightclub\">movie</a> twice, but I bought a copy for myself recently and was really in the mood to watch it yesterday. I needed something uplifting. After mulling this movie over in my head more and more, I came to like it that much more. Everyone should see this movie, and hopefully soon I'll actually read the book too.</p>
80240|mulhollanddrive|DVD at home|2002-07-04|<p>I'm not a die-hard Lynch fan, and haven't even seen his TV series that many people rave about. The movie barely entered my radar when it was in the theaters. But then my roommate contacted me and said he could get the DVD for just over $5, so I figured there was nothing to loose there, given that the movie did get excellent reviews.</p><p>Wow, how do you summarize the plot of a David Lynch movie, particularly when the movie is a mystery. There is a traffic accident on Mulholland Drive, and the woman who manages to survive wanders down into Hollywood. She ends up in a home soon to be occupied by Betty, an innocent girl from Canada looking to make it into pictures. Rita, as she calls herself after looking at an old movie poster, doesn't remember who she is. That, and she has a bag full of money and a key. We also have a movie director, Adam, who is being forced to cast a particular actress in his lead role. That, and Billy Ray Cyrus is banging his wife.</p><p>The movie is good, and I will watch it again at some point, probably in an attempt to make sense of everything. There are shifts at a few points that were hard to follow for me because I confused a couple actresses, but I think I've figure out now. The DVD comes with some clues to help you along in analyzing the mystery, but I failed to read them ahead of time. Don't make the same mistake if you are watching this film.</p><p>I can definitely understand why this movie got such high marks. Besides the amazing cinematography, the plot is quite interesting to follow. If only it was easier to piece together.</p>
80241|boysdontcry|DVD at home|2002-07-04|<p>Another one of those movies that I've sorta been wanting to see for a while, but just never got around to it. Cannot say this is the kind of movie that most of the people I hang out with are gonna watch. But the subject matter, and that it got quite a bit of acclaim from respectable quarters was enough for me to finally sit down with it.</p><p>Teena Brandon wants to be a guy, but it keeps getting her in trouble. She isn't up front about her sexuality, and given that she grew up in Nebraska, it should go without saying that the reaction when others find out is generally hostile. Chopping her hair short, she ends up in a small town, getting  mixed in with some \"white trash\" there. She falls in love with Lana, but trouble with the law threatens to reveal to all her new friends what she really is.</p><p>The movie is quite touching and extraordinarily well done. The acting is  excellent, and the depiction of midwestern life in generally accurate. Teena isn't the perfect person, and rarely seems to make the right decisions, but that is the charm of the movie. Being based on real events, don't expect a happy ending.</p><p>I liked the film, though I cannot say I'd want to watch it again. Obviously, if the depiction of a midwestern lesbian with image issues doesn't appeal to you, then the film isn't worth checking out, but otherwise it is worth the go. And hey, the lead actress is actually from the same town as the main character.</p>
80242|akira|DVD at home|2002-07-05|<p>Like many of my generation, this was the first real anime I saw. I don't remember when it was, sometime in high school after it was already out on video. But when it came out, it was absolutely amazing: for its animation as well as the story. When they released it on DVD after cleaning it up and redoing the translation, I had to buy it. But then I never got around to watching it. I owe this to half-days.</p><p>Tetsuo, Kaneda and the rest of their friends are a teenage biker gang (believe me, that doesn't sound as bizarre in Japan as it does here) in Neo-Tokyo, the year 2029 (or 2030). World War III had been set off by a new type of weapon exploding and destroying old Tokyo. The government is slowly losing control of things, and the military is stepping up its presence. In this, Tetsuo crashes his bike into a psionic kid, unleashing powers in his own body as a result. Kaneda and company do what they can to help their friend, but they are just teenages and the military is involved. Then there is the question of Akira, around which a number of people have developed a  doomsday cult.</p><p>Although the animation isn't nearly as impressive now, the movie is still quite enjoyable. I also feel that I understand what's going on much better with age, because the ending was quite baffling the first time I saw the movie. It is only appropriate that this movie introduced a lot of people to anime, because the underlying theme is basically the same one you get in every other Japanese sci-fi. That is, what is the result of technology on mankind and how can we deal with it. For many, that's a very tired question, but it all gets made up for in the storytelling.</p><p>If by some chance you haven't seen this film yet, it is definitely worth checking out, and not just as a \"history\" lesson. I'm not a big anime fan, since most of it is immature crap. This is one of the rare ones that can hold adult interest.</p>
80243|dasboot|DVD at home|2002-07-07|<p>I hadn't heard of this movie until they released the director's cut a few years ago. At that time, a friend of mine into German military history helped bring the movie to my attention. I'd been wanting to see it since then, though not with any great motivation. The 3-and-a-half hour run time on it is what kept killing it as a selection when I went to the video store. As it stands, I had this DVD on hand for a month before I finally sat down to watch the whole thing.</p><p>The German U-boats, once the scourge of the seas, were quickly losing their threat as World War II progressed and technology advanced. In the end, three-quarters of the U-boats that went out never came back. Despite this, Hitler insisted on sending them out. Our story starts with the crew of a boat the night before they are to set sail. With so many sailors in a watery grave, the captain in his mid-thirties is an old man compared to his crew of 17-25 year olds. On board is an observer, who takes photos and expects to report back to the fatherland about the majesty of the ships and their crews. What follows is the nightmare which being trapped in a boat under seas.</p><p>Although incredibly slow at times, this movie does what it set out to do, which is give the viewer a sense of what it was like to be on one of these ships. I could tell that seeing this film in a theater could be worth it, since the sound is of utmost importance. You really develop a sympathy for what these guys had to go through. To boot, it is all based on real-life experience (of the guy who plays the observer, I believe).</p><p>This movie isn't for everyone. You have to be sincerely interested in the issues, in watching a serious movie to gain an understanding of what things were like for other people. The action is spaced too far apart for your average film, but it is worth watching.</p>
80244|usualsuspects|DVD at home|2002-07-08|<p>I think this movie came out while I was in Japan. At least, that seems like the best excuse for why I'd never heard of it. Then a few years ago, I was introduced to it by my roommate at the time. I got hold of the movie then and watched it with my girlfriend from the time, and then she watched it again the next day she liked it so much. When I heard that it was being released as a special edition DVD, it wasn't a hard choice as to whether I was going to buy it.</p><p>Six weeks ago, the usual suspects were all called in to be in a line up for a heist of a truck moving gun parts. Unable to pin the crime on anyone, they all get released, but then decide to do a job together anyway. Getting their hands on some emeralds, then they have to head to Los Angeles to fence the goods. A series of event leads up to last night, with an explosion at the harbor leaving a large number of dead bodies and only two survivors. One is a Hungarian man with burns over most of his body. The other is Verbal Kent, who has been granted immunity.</p><p>The ending of this movie is still great, even when you know its coming. Everything fits together so nicely. It's hard to really explain things any more than this. The only other thing I can think of is just to point out that this is one of those movies where you are going to be routing for the \"bad guys.\"</p><p>If you haven't seen this film yet, I have to ask why. The only excuse I can think of for anyone is that they are timid of violence, but I don't find that an acceptable excuse.</p>
80245|lagaan|DVD at home|2002-07-08|<p>I'd never seen an Indian movie, and had been meaning to for a while. I mean, they have one of the most prolific industries in the world (maybe second only to Hollywood, but I haven't checked the statistics). I'd heard plenty about them, partly through discussions with Indian friends of mine. In any case, this title has been thrown about a bit (was it nominated for some kind of award?), and has been playing in a few different art venues here in L.A. over the last year, so it seemed like as good a place to start as any.</p><p>In the late 1800s, India was controlled by a number of small Rajas, who in turn were controlled by the British colonial government. Few were happy with this situation (the British excepted, of course). When the proclamation comes that the tax (lagaan) for the year will be doubled, the farmers who are facing a horrible drought appeal to the Raj to have the tax lowered, but since the tax is set by the British, there is little he can do about it. Bhuvan, a young unmarried man, ends up confronting the British officer in charge, and the officer (Captain Andrew Russell) offers a bet. If the farmers can beat the British in a game of cricket, then the tax will be canceled for 3 years. If they lose, however, they will have to pay triple tax. Bhuvan faces an uphill battle getting villagers to join his team and learn the game, but he has the assistance (and growing affection) of the Captain's sister, Elizabeth. To make the triangle complete, the beautiful Gauri is doing her best to capture Bhuvan's heart.</p><p>The production values on this film are on par with anything that has ever come out of Hollywood. It was a bit jarring the first time the actors broke into a song and dance routine (a staple of ALL Indian cinema), but it soon felt expected. The songs actually are an essential element of the story, and are quite catchy as well. The acting is convincing as well. The fascinating thing for me was that I knew how the story was going to end once the basic elements were laid out, but it still held my attention for FOUR HOURS. That's right, this movie is almost 4 hours long (over 4 hours if you watch the cut scenes on the DVD). One last thing to address was the attention to diversity. Interestingly enough, they only make light of it in regards to the \"untouchables,\" but if you pay close attention you will also notice that there are at least three different religions represented on the team.</p><p>If, like myself, you've not seen any Indian cinema, this is a great place to start. You're going to have to set some time aside to watch it, but if you can get behind a fun movie with a wholesome message, then it is worth it.</p>
80246|mrniceguy|DVD at home|2002-07-09|<p>I'd seen this movie when it was released in the theaters here in the U.S. To be honest, I think this may be the only non-U.S. Jackie Chan film that I'd seen that way, since most I caught as Hong Kong films shown in specialty theaters and such. Anyway, I heard that the Hong Kong version of the film contained quite a bit more scenes, so last September I ordered the DVD. The DVD finally arrived on Monday (long story), and since I was home sick I got to watch it right away.</p><p>Jackie is a TV chef in Melbourne. His girlfriend has just come into town. But then a TV reporter who has just videotaped a drug deal between rival gangs runs into Jackie as she is trying to escape from them. As they flee, her videotape gets mixed in with some in Jackie's car, and so when they part she accidentally ends up with one of his cooking shows. Obviously, the gangs are anxious to get the tape back, but Jackie doesn't realize that he is supposed to have it. Things get personal when they kidnap his girlfriend Miki in order to force him to turn it over. No more Mr. Nice Guy.</p><p>Complete plot is definitely not one of this movie's strong elements, but Jackie is just so amazing to watch. There are some really impressive fights and stunts in this film. Interestingly enough, the movie doesn't really have a final fight scene. You're not going to watch this for deep philosophy anyway.</p><p>Although not Jackie's greatest all-around movie by any ranking, it is definitely a fun movie to watch. Of course, having seen something like 45 Jackie Chan films, it should be clear where I stand on these issues.</p>
80247|focus|DVD at home|2002-07-17|<p>This got good recommendations from the people I know who saw it. Also, I  know that Arthur Miller's an excellent author/playwright, so any movie based on a work of his is likely to be better than average. Then there's the subject matter, which is one that's just as timely today as it was when written. Of course, the fact that my roommate could ask whether discrimination like in the film actually took place means that this kind of film is necessary.</p><p>Lawrence Newman is fairly unassuming, living his sheltered life in New York City in 1943. But the neighbors are getting riled about the Jewish man who lives and owns a shop on the corner. And at work, his boss forces him to get glasses after he hires a Jewish woman to work in the typing pool. But when he gets glasses, everyone starts to think that he looks Jewish, too. He falls in love with another woman with the same problem, i.e. that she looks Jewish, but things are looking up and there isn't much trouble... for a while.</p><p>This is an excellent film that pulls in a great deal of history (though names are changed, Father Coughlin is Father Crighton, for example) to tell a tale that was all too common during the second World War. Through the process, a man who thinks he can just avoid the conflict since it doesn't apply to him finds out that he is sorely wrong. Try as he might, there is not middle road that can be taken. That really sums up why I think this is such a great movie, because I firmly believe that people who stand in the middle of the road get run over.</p><p>For a few moments, the film waxes artistic, but even those moments make sense by the time you've reached the end of the film. There is no one who I wouldn't recommend this film to. Besides the wonderful story, there is excellent acting all around.</p>
80248|labrassiere|DVD at home|2002-07-19|<p>I'm not sure where I heard of this film, probably while looking through Hong Kong movie reviews online. In any case, it grabbed my attention. The premise was clearly absurd, and I couldn't expect much from it, but I knew it was a Hong Kong romantic comedy, right?</p><p>Johnny and Wayne are hired by a bra company and given three months to design the \"ultimate bra.. While Samantha, who heads the company knows that her job depends upon their results (or she loses her job), Lena has every interest in seeing these two fellows fail in a field she feels they shouldn't even be in. The guys' first attempts aren't successful at all, as vouched for by the English-speaking bra model, but there is hope as they see the challenge ahead of them and get some help.</p><p>Let's just say that this film isn't going to break any new grounds in the relationships between women and men. The early parts of the films are patently sexist and some of it almost unbearable at times. As a simple example, when the guys show up for their first day in the office, the entire place is in the bathroom dolling itself up. I know this was meant to be funny, but it ended up being more offensive than anything. There are several other places in the film which depict women as intellectually insufficient when men are around.</p><p>The movie is also quite funny at times. Although overly absurd, when the men have to wear fake breasts and bras, you cannot help but laugh. As for the ending, I'm still undecided how I feel about it. Lau Ching-Wan's last scene with Carina is done well, but the wasn't quite enough realism for everything to pull through for me.</p><p>I cannot really recommend this film in good conscience. It recovers a bit from a bad start, but never enough for me to say I'd watch it again.</p>
80249|johnq|DVD at home|2002-07-20|<p>I had wanted to see this film after I first saw the trailer. I knew it would get kinda sappy and was definitely a Hollywood production, but it still promised to have some merit just because of the subject matter. Well, I never made it to the theater, but I rented it on DVD as soon as I could.</p><p>John has been cut back to 20 hours at the plant for a while, and together  with his wife and her mcjob, they are having trouble making ends meet. And then, during a baseball game their son collapses from heart trouble. It doesn't take long before we find out that he needs a transplant or he is going to die. But, his insurance doesn't cover that kind of procedure and all the other avenues they go down aren't able to help them out either. When the hospital is threatening to discharge their son, John decides that it is time to take action and takes the emergency room of the hospital hostage until they can put his son on the organ waiting list.</p><p>There weren't a lot of surprises once the movie gets going about where this film was produced. The real strength of this film is the beginning. I don't feel that Denzel plays a very convincing working class guy, but perhaps this is just because I've seen him in too many other roles. In any case, we get to see a situation which is all too common in this country. At the top, we have the best health care in the world. At the bottom, care is available but the quality leaves a lot to be desired. And then in the middle is a huge section of the working class that doesn't have insurance or adequate insurance. And the so-called \"safety net\" in this country is more illusion than anything. This movie does a decent job of highlighting that situation.</p><p>The downside of this movie is that it is Hollywood. The movie could have been much better, much more believable. There are a few roles, the most important being the chief of police, which are completely unbelievable. There is also a bit too much melodrama.</p><p>I still recommend this film. It isn't perfect, but is worth watching. If you get the DVD, there are some nice extras interspersed throughout the film that provide more information about the reality behind the film (though, they also have a touch of Hollywood melodrama to them as well).</p>
80250|akaihashinoshitano|ArcLight Hollywood|2002-07-20|<p>I'd heard about this film a while back, and it seems like it took forever to finally get into the theaters here in L.A. I like the Imamura films I have seen so far (probably about 5 or 6), and was up for seeing this film without really having much of an idea of what it was about. Since I got out of class early on Saturday, I headed to the theater to catch an earlier showing.</p><p>Sasano is unemployed in Tokyo and his wife and son have moved away. A homeless friend of his dies, and he decides to track down a hidden treasure the old man claims to have left up on the Noto peninsula. Living in the house is Saeko, who he witnesses shoplifting while standing in a pool of water (yes, that should sound strange). Before long, he's also landed a job as a fisherman.</p><p>The film is well done overall, though I cannot say that it comes up to the level of Imamura's other movies. There is a little bit in here, particularly with his situation at the beginning of the film, that reflects upon the political, but for the most part this is simply and interesting and quirky story. I was caught off-guard when the two leads had their first \"encounter\" and that added to the enjoyment of the film.</p><p>One thing I want to pipe in about. I paid $11 to see this film, and that is only because the show started before 6pm, normally it is $14. As a result, I cannot say that there is any good reason to see a movie at the ArcLight theater. The seating is assigned, and the chairs are better quality than many theaters, but they are also immobile. And hell, the host couldn't even pronounce \"Shohei Imamura\" correctly, which may seem minor, but it really just shows you what kind of theater this place was (at art theaters the people working there tend to know about the movies as well). I don't plan to visit that place again.</p><p>I recommend the film. It was quite enjoyable to watch and has a few unexpected surprises.</p>
80251|ghostinlove|Korean Cultural Center|2002-07-24|<p>Well, I'd never heard of this film until I got the message that it was the free film being shown this month at the <a href=\"http://www.kccla.org\" title=\"KCCLA\">Korean Cultural Center</a>. I read the synopsis, and that got my interest. Besides, free film and free time just go hand in hand.</p><p>Chae-byul is being dumped by her fiancee so that he can marry the boss's daughter. Angry over this, she wishes she was dead. Unfortunately, a Suicide Society in the netherworld is there to make sure she follows through, and helps push her in front of a train. Trapped as a sort of ghost, she then has to recruit new members. She is torn between her partner, a man who seems all too sympathetic to humans and isn't recruiting anyone, and another  ghost knows as Pale Face, who having taken her life after being gang raped is intent on seeing each of her assailants die a horrible death (which is something forbidden by the netherworld authorities, guys known as the \"messengers\"). Should Chae-byul haunt her former lover or should she forgive and forget.</p><p>In the end, this is a romance, which is sort of what I expected (especially with that title). There are a lot of special effect thrown in to boot. On the down side, those special effects aren't very good many times. They do a good jobs at certain effects, but fail miserably at others. In addition, the editing and story flow is a bit choppy at times, which doesn't mesh well with the style of film. The story is interesting, but nothing amazing. The main selling point of the film is that the main actress is damn gorgeous.</p><p>I probably wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. There are much better specimens of Korean film out there that should be sampled long before this film is even considered.</p>
80252|beastcops|Laemmle Sunset 5 Theatre|2002-07-27|<p>As yet another test of my endurance, this film was shown last weekend for the <a href=\"http://www.asianfilm.org/events/MAS_071802.html\" title=\"Midnight At Sunset\">Midnight @ Sunset</a> series. I'd heard of the film a while back, but like most movies, I couldn't remember anything about it except the title. But hey, it had some pretty high endorsements, so it couldn't be half bad, right.</p><p>Tung has been on the police force for a while. Everyone in the triads knows him, and knows they can count on him. And then Michael comes in to head the group. Michael has some different ideas about how things should be run, but he also still needs to be shown around the new territory. After an shoddy assassination job, Big Brother accidentally runs his car into the assassin and kills him, and he has to flee Hong Kong for a while. In the meantime, Pushy Pin steps up to take the reigns, but he has different ideas about how things should be run.</p><p>This is an excellent movie that doesn't rely on non-stop action to keep you interested, but interesting characters and development. Michael comes across a little odd, since it is obvious that English is his first language, but still does a decent job. Everyone else is great. One nice surprise is that the main actress in the movie is not in the least bit attractive. I don't mean this to unsell the movie, just that it is always a bit refreshing to see people in movies who aren't \"perfect.\"</p><p>This one's definitely worth catching. I've seen reviewers of the movie say that it turned around Hong Kong cinema, and although I cannot really assess that statement, I can see how it surely did some good.</p>
80253|pedicabdriver|Egyptian Theatre|2002-07-29|<p>Well, Monday was a hectic night. I got to the theater around 4 p.m., volunteering for the <a href=\"http://www.asianfilm.org/\" title=\"Asian Film Foundation\">Asian Film Foundation's</a> presentation of this classic Sammo film. I'd never seen the film, but know Sammo's work fairly well. I'm not the kind of guy to get star struck, though, so having Sammo on hand wasn't all that impressive. He's a pretty funny guy though, and his English isn't that bad.</p><p>Tung is a pedicab driver who lives with his auntie, who runs a bakery. Besides an older fellow, the rest of the employees are young women, including Ping, who catches the eye of both the head baker and Tung. One of the other pedicab drivers also falls in love with a woman, and they both seem to be making a cute couple until this other woman's background is revealed. And then to top it all off, this brings about conflict with Master 5, who appears to be behind most things illegal (and brutal) around town.</p><p>This is a very enjoyable film that is loaded with familiar faces, even in lesser roles. The fighting and choreography is also top notch. The plot is fairly simple, though not quite what one would expect. And the humor is quite well done. I can certainly understand why some people consider this to be Sammo's best film.</p><p>Although you've already missed one of the rare chances to see this film on the big screen (and the print was nice and clean, too), it is still worth getting hold of this film if you can. If you are a Sammo fan, it is a must.</p>
80254|strawdogs|DVD at home|2002-08-01|<p>I didn't really know who Sam Peckinpah was until a couple coworkers were talking about his films one day. The main point they had to make about him was his graphic violence. The stories also seemed interesting as well. I finally got around to seeing one of his films while at home sick on Thursday.</p><p>David Sumner is a mathematics professor who has gotten a grant for a year, and thus taken the opportunity to leave the U.S. and its politics and violence behind him. He moves with his wife to her hometown in rural England, in her father's old place. But he soon learns that his cowardly attempt to flee has been futile, for even in this small town there are forces at work that he cannot simply hide from.</p><p>I really liked this movie. I was expecting somewhat senseless violence, and it turned out to be quite directed. Not that the violence at the end wasn't nice, because I have to say I didn't see the man trap's use coming in the way it did. But, the truly important thing about this film is how it addresses cowardice and the attempt to hide from reality. This is not to say that this is the most political of films, or necessarily the best way to get the message across, but it was effective. The main character and his wife both have situations thrust upon them, and there is no way to deal with them without direct confrontation. How refreshing.</p><p>Everyone could benefit from watching this film. The mindless jock types will enjoy the brutality and brief nudity, while everyone else will get a dose of what happens to people who refuse to take sides.</p>
80255|dragonheart2|Video at friend's house|2002-08-02|<p>Well, I'm not even sure I realized this film existed. I had wanted to see the first film at some point, but have just never gotten around to it (because hey! Sean Connery as a dragon sounds like fun). But then when you are a guest at someone else's house and they want to watch it (they being a 12-year-old), and they sell it by telling you about dragons and kung fu all in the same film, you say, \"why not.\" What else was I going to do, go to sleep?</p><p>Geoff is a stable boy, but he wants to be a knight. Things start to change when he discovers that a dragon has been hidden beneath the monastery. The king's new councilor discovers them both, and takes them under his wing. But new in town are a couple of people from the east, where dragons were completely destroyed many years ago. They are following rumors that a dragon may still live, and if so, that dragon may bring about the doom of mankind when the  double-tailed comet streaks through the sky in a week.</p><p>I didn't realize this was a children's film going into it. I thought that it was geared towards a wider audience, but make no mistake, this is for the young crowd. This should be really obvious when the film finishes without taking advantage of a possible love interest with the very fine Ms. Figueroa. In any case, there aren't a lot of surprises here, though some of them take a little while to be uncovered. Swordplay is quite simple and cheesy, the usual clanging of metal together to simulate fighting. The choreography on the kung fu is also very clean and simple, and almost all the moves are pulled straight from wu shu forms. Although I enjoyed watching Rona, I'd have rather had a different context.</p><p>There really is no reason to see this film, unless you have not yet reached puberty, in which case it is probably as good as most of the other stuff put out for that age range. It is fun to watch and the story is fairly tight, so I wouldn't tell anyone to run for the hills either.</p>
80256|mib|Video at friend's house|2002-08-04|<p>I saw this a long time ago, probably in '98 or so. It hadn't really looked that good to me when the previews came out, so it took me a while to see it, and at this point I cannot remember what got me motivated in the first place. In any case, still at the mercy of the host, I got to watch this again. I'll probably catch the second one when it comes out on DVD, since I'm in no way inclined to pay $9 to see it sooner.</p><p>Officer James Edwards has a very weird experience chasing down a perp in NYC. The guy has a gun that disintegrates into nothing when it hits the ground, is able to climb walls, and has two sets of eyelids. Enter K, who works for the Men in Black, the earth's alien division. With K's partner recently retired, he's looking for someone new and Edwards fits the bill. But there are no routine days for the MIB, and a bug lands on earth looking to get his hands on a galaxy. The people who own the galaxy are willing to destroy the earth to prevent this galaxy from landing in the bug's hands.</p><p>This is a fairly witty and funny film. I remember being surprised when I first saw it several years ago. My opinion didn't really change with a second viewing. There are some truly great scenes, though one of my favorite still has to be the firearms test at the beginning.</p><p>Most people who would want to see this film probably already have, especially with the sequel out in theaters now, so there isn't much for me to really say. There isn't any substance, but it's a good action comedy with sci-fi themes.</p>
80257|shurayukihime2001|Egyptian Theatre|2002-08-09|<p>I cannot say I'd heard of this movie until I read about it in the calendar, but it definitely grabbed my attention. Given how few Japanese movies I have seen, especially more recent films, I'm always looking for more. When a local theater puts in the effort to show one of them, I tend to assume that it must be better than average. Besides, this one also features a woman killing people with swords... what could be wrong with this movie?</p><p>Yuki is a member of a clan of assassins. They used to be the private guard to a king in a neighboring kingdom, but then things changed, so they took up a new profession. As she is hunting down a defector from the clan, she encounters a man who knew her mother. He proceeds to tell her about her mother's death, who was responsible for it, and what Yuki can expect when she turns 20-years-old tomorrow. Meanwhile, Takashi, who runs a gas station out in the middle of nowhere, is coming to understand what the underground group he has been involved with is really about. All of this is set in the backdrop of a society somewhere between the future and the past.</p><p>This movie is quite fun, and the bits of society you get at the edge of the film are intriguing. There's clearly an idea there of a totalitarian society, loosely Orwellian in conception, with a mix of high technology with swordplay. The acting is pretty decent as well. My only complaint, besides the movie slowing down at times, is that there are several times when it is clear that the main actress isn't as comfortable with those swords in her hands as she ought to be. Nonetheless, the fighting is quite good (choreographed by Donnie Yen) with some interesting and creative ideas put out there.</p><p>I would recommend this movie to people who like the genre, or perhaps even to general sci-fi fans. It really isn't for other people, but it is still an enjoyable film that I wouldn't mind seeing again at some point in the future.</p>
80258|nightofthehunter|James Bridge Theater at UCLA|2002-08-10|<p>It is entirely possible that this movie entered my consciousness through the side door because of <strong>The Simpsons</strong>. Of course, the whole \"Love\" and \"Hate\" (or \"Luv\" \"Hat\", long \"a\") tattoos on the fingers has been done in many, many places, but I believe this was the first, or at least the one that brought it to the foreground of popular culture. The movie was did dismally in the theaters back in 1955, but UCLA saw fit to restore it. To boot, they had the producer and several other members of the cast and crew (or their children) on hand to talk about the film afterwards.</p><p>Rev. Harry Powell has a special relationship with god, which is revealed in a conversation he has with his god while driving to the location of our story. Powell has just gotten out of prison, where he shared a cell with a man who robbed a bank and successfully hid the money. When that man is executed without revealing the whereabouts of that money, Powell sets about to find it. Shortly, he is married to Mrs. Harper, which gives him excellent access to the two children, John and Pearl, whom he is certain know the location of the money.</p><p>This is a fun movie to watch, with the story revolving around a good vs. evil concept which is quite simplistic. Robert Mitchum does an excellent job, and and I have to say that the kids do as well. In the end, there really isn't anything unexpected about this film, though it is still fun to see Lillian Gish playing the role you expect by that time of the film has come. I do have to say, though, that the film could have been better from a technical standpoint, and could have used more subtlety.</p><p>This isn't such a stellar movie that I think everyone should see it. It was fun, but I cannot imagine ever seeing it again. If the plot grabs your interest, or you are a particularly big fan of any of the actors, go ahead and watch it and you won't be disappointed, but otherwise save your time.</p>
80259|monstersball|DVD at home|2002-08-10|<p>My knowledge of this film was fairly limited up until the time I actually saw it. I knew the bit about him being a prison guard and her husband being executed, but that was it. Then, of course, she won the Oscar, so I figured that her acting had to be halfway decent. Then, later, I was told that the only reason Halle won the Oscar was because she showed her tits. What an incentive to see the film.</p><p>Hank works as a Louisiana corrections officer, as does his son. Hank is in charge of making sure Lawrence's execution goes off smoothly, but it doesn't thanks to Sonny, Hank's son. Then there is Hank's dad, Buck, who is fervently racist and has Hank go after black kids with a shotgun to keep them off their land. Lawrence's wife, Leticia, and son are having a hard time of it. She is losing the house, which she cannot afford to make payments on with her job as a waitress. Not unrelated events begin to bring Hank and Leticia together at a time when they both need someone.</p><p>This is a hard film. What I mean is that there are very few uplifting moments as the ground is being set. You do get a happy ending, of sorts, but it comes at a high cost. This is not to detract from the film, though, because there are many positive aspects to it. You really do get a sense of the lives of the people it focuses on, including the very real hardships that people face when they are living at the bottom. In the end, the story is one of a man still able to change despite his age.</p><p>As for Berry and her performance, it comes across fairly decent while you are wrapped up into the film. But when I watched a clip of the film without the emotional build-up, I was impressed with how bad she is as an actress. Having experience with people at the station she is trying to portray, she just doesn't come across as sincere.</p><p>Besides an interesting story and characters, the symbolism of the film is fairly simple and easy to grasp. My favorite (and the most obvious) is the symbolism behind sex, particularly the initial similarities between the father and the son, and in the end in how it really is something different for those who have figured something out.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to anyone who likes a good movie. It is a bumpy road to get to the ending, and some people may not understand why it ends the way it does, but it was worth it.</p>
80260|timebandits|DVD at home|2002-08-11|<p>This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. But, as time drags on and my memory being what it is, I couldn't really remember much about it. I was also certain that what I got out of a Terry Gilliam film 20 years ago is nothing compared to what I would get out of it watching now.</p><p>Kevin's family life is certainly nothing to shout about, and so he spends his time reading and fantasizing about history and legends. And then one night six dwarves who have stolen a map from the supreme being come through his wardrobe. Before he knows it, he is dropped down with them in the time of Napolean (who they, of course, get to meet). The dwarves are aspiring bandits, who hope to use the map of holes in creation to travel throughout time and make themselves rich. Things first go awry when Kevin gets stuck in ancient Greece. But then there is also the evil genius who knows the map is out there and hopes to grab it himself, in order to remake creation to his own designs.</p><p>The movie is still quite fun, especially now that I know a little more about some of the situations that the characters end up in, but it didn't end up exciting me as much as I expected. It is still a cult classic, and I'm happy to have refreshed my memory about it, but it doesn't have the repeat viewing power I was expecting. I was pleased with lines like \"We agreed that there would be no leader.. \"That's right, so shut up and do what I say.\" The twist of the film is the commentary on technology, which Kevin's parents' lives revolve around and the evil genius sees and the answer to all problems.</p><p>If you are a Gilliam fan, then you definitely have to see this film. It also just has general appeal to hackers, geeks and fantasy nuts. Otherwise, it is an enjoyable film, but not one I could necessarily recommend to everyone.</p>
80261|circle|DVD at home|2002-08-12|<p>I'm not sure where I heard about this movie, or why I thought it would be such a good choice for my first foray into Iranian cinema, but it was what ended up at the top of my queue when the time came. I've had a few friends who've told me about this or that Iranian film, and they always struck me as somewhat artsy though still addressing real issues. That's probably why this one seemed like a good choice.</p><p>The movie does not have a central character, but instead passes the narrative from one woman to the next. We begin in a maternity ward, where a woman has just had a baby girl... and this is a problem. Remember her name, you will hear it again in the film. Then there is Nargess, a 19-year-old who has just gotten out of prison along with a couple friends, and they are looking to get out of town as soon as possible. Unfortunately it doesn't prove so easy to leave Tehran. Next is Pari, who has escaped from prison in part because she is pregnant. Since the father of the child has been executed, she needs to get an abortion, but without the father's approval that just isn't so easy to do. Later we meet a mother, who has chosen to abandon her little girl instead of raising her alone. She knows that without a husband, neither of them stand a chance. The final focus is on a prostitute, who has accepted the position of women in Iranian society and is no longer afraid to just put that bluntly.</p><p>This is one of the greatest films I've seen in a long time. It is a bit slow at times, but does an excellent job of getting its points across and of using symbolism and cinema to make the viewer actually think about the lot of other people in the world. If the film has any failing, it is that it doesn't make it clear that the circumstances that women are facing in Iran are universal, that women in all countries face similar if not the exact same adversities in their daily lives. There are so many great lines and situations in this film.</p><p>Everyone should see this film. It's that simple.</p>
80262|lifeasahouse|DVD at home|2002-08-14|<p>Other than hearing about this after it came out, it really didn't hit my radar much. It sounded like a decent movie from the reviews, and a few people I've talk to seemed to like it, but I couldn't have told you anything else about it before watching it.</p><p>George Monroe is an architect who lives in Palos Verdes (one of the richest areas in Los Angeles), but he lives in what is essentially a shack. Needless to say, his neighbors aren't very big fans of his. His 16-year-old son, who lives with his ex-wife and her husband and two kids, wears make-up, has numerous piercings, and doesn't like anyone. When he gets fired from his job of 20 years and he finds out he only has a few months left to live, he realizes that he has to take the bull by the horns and make some changes before his life is over. With summer vacation on, he forces his son to live with him for the summer, where they will tear down his old house and build up one that he designed a long time ago.</p><p>This is a very touching and warm film that will likely make people cry. There aren't a lot of surprises as far as the overall plot goes, but it is still enjoyable along the way. The film has an excellent sense of humor that seems to be injected at all the right moments. The downside is that it co-stars Hayden Christensen, who has no acting ability whatsoever. If you've already seen <short=\"episode2\">Episode 2</a>, then you've already seen the role he plays. This performance is exactly the same!</p><p>I really liked this film and would recommend it to people who want to watch a sentimental drama. That statement should be enough to qualify what kind of people won't like it, but it isn't such a monumental film that everyone should see it anyway.</p>
80263|georgewashington|DVD at home|2002-08-15|<p>When this circulated at the art houses here, it caught my attention, but I  wasn't able to go see it. And then I heard that it was being released on DVD by <a href=\"http://www.criterionco.com\" title=\"Criterion Collection\">Criterion</a> it confirmed to me that the movie was definitely worth seeing. Having went home sick from work yesterday, after a nap I had this in the mail, so I sat down and watched it.</p><p>Several poor kids in a Southern town, mostly black with one white girl, spend their time playing at various abandoned structures. George has a medical problem that makes his head very sensitive, so he doesn't roughhouse the way the other kids do. While they are playing at an abandoned amusement park one afternoon in June, one of the kids dies. Conscious of their place in life already, they decide to hide the body and not tell anyone. The remainder of the movie follows how they each deal with this decision.</p><p>I haven't watched the extras yet on the DVD, so the jury is still holding out for a final vote, but this movie didn't impress me as much as I had hoped it would. Although you do get to see a bit of the lives these kids live, it isn't very detailed and much of the film is conversation of a somewhat unbelievable nature, particularly when the kids and adults are talking to one another. Near the end, things even descend into complete illusion, and it is hard to tell what the director meant to be \"real\" and what was supposed to be the imagination of one of the kids.</p><p>At this point, I wouldn't really recommend this film to anyone. Instead of a story that moved me or made me think, by the end I felt I had watched a film about people who weren't of much concern to me. I wasn't angry at the hour and a half, but I was still hungry for food for thought.</p>
80264|martialangeles|DVD at home|2002-08-16|<p>So what was the reason for seeing this film. Plain and simple... seven very attractive Chinese women. I didn't have much expectations besides that, but I knew that would be enough for my friend, and likely enough for me.</p><p>Cat used to be a thief, but has gone straight for the last 3 years. And then a Russian mobster kidnaps her ex-boyfriend with the intent of forcing Cat into stealing something for him (a virus protection software). With feelings still just under the surface for her ex, Cat calls on some old friends. 6 of them to be exact, who are all professional thieves as well (and they all grew up in the same orphanage). It will take all of their skills to recover her old flame.</p><p>Not having seen <short=\"charliesangels\" title=\"Charlie's Angels\">Charlie's Angels</a>, I can only relay that this movie draws from that in part (and thus probably the reason for the title). Beyond that, this is a standard action movie with quite possibly too many people to keep track of, all of them named after one animal or another. The action and the comedy mix well to make this a fun movie to watch, but they don't really make it memorable.</p><p>I don't have any real complaints about this film, but it also doesn't register as a stellar film, either. Hong Kong action fans could do better, but they could also do much, much worse, so there isn't any particular reason to avoid the movie.</p>
80265|orenisawaru|DVD at home|2002-08-18|<p>I first heard of this film when it was shown at the Egyptian Theatre a while back as part of a Japanese Outlaw Masters film series. It caught my attention, but I didn't go see it or any of the other films of the series. But then the same people decided to put it and another film out on DVD, so when I saw them available, I stuck them in my queue.</p><p>Hondo is a war photographer who falls in love with a stewardess when he returns home to Japan. Unfortunately, she is kidnapped during their first date. Hondo then witnesses a Hispanic guy get killed by three black-tight clad women. His life is spared when they shoot bubblegum into his eyes and flee the scene. With a little investigation while trying to avoid the police, soon American and Japanese gangsters are in the picture as well, hoping to recover gold hidden by Yoriko's (the stewardess) father following World War II.</p><p>From the get-go, this movie is clearly hip as can be. The intro scene very consciously calls upon Bond imagery, with the women who turn out to be the black-tight killers go-go dancing while the credits roll. Everything after that is just as fun to watch, with the style of action and adventure you expect from the genre and time. Hondo lives at a ninja research center. The black-tight killers do turn out to be both ninja and go-go dancers in the evenings. And then there are the fight scenes, which just have a wonderful rhythm as Hondo wails on one person or another.</p><p>This movie isn't for fans of more serious films, but it is will be quite fun for everyone else, particularly if you are a fan of the early James Bond material.</p>
80266|tokyoeyes|VCD at home|2002-08-21|<p>I first heard of this movie a couple months ago, after asking someone if there were any mainstream Japanese movies of any worth, since the last decent movie I saw from Japan which was also popular in Japan was <strong>Shall We Dansu?</strong>. Some of these other Japanese movies I have seen lately might have been fun, but they are also fringe cinema that don't get much attention in their homeland. Anyway, I got in the mood to order some VCDs last week, and was able to get this one fairly cheap, so I figured, \"why not?\".</p><p>Hinano is spending her summer vacation with her older brother in Tokyo, where he works as a police detective. There have been a string of shootings by someone known as \"Four Eyes.. He hasn't killed anyone, though, just scared the hell out of them. Coming home from work one day, Hinano sees a guy who acts fairly weird, and it comes together in her head that he may be the shooter her brother is looking for. She then tracks him down herself, and after they meet things begin to change for both of them.</p><p>The first thing that really struck me about this film was Hinano, who was just an excellent casting decision. It isn't that she's incredibly attractive (at least not to me), but that she fits into the 17-year-old role she plays quite well. The way she bubbles, her genuinely naive appearance and her laugh just make the character very believable to me.</p><p>The film as a whole is interesting and fun to watch, though I will not say that everything is wholly comprehensible. K, who takes on the \"Four Eyes\" persona, is a consciously odd character who I still did not grasp by the end of the film. The idea behind his shootings is, however, interesting. In the end, the movies is something of a growing-up and falling in love story, without being nearly as overbearing about it as many such films are.</p><p>I enjoyed the film and would recommend it to people who are looking for interesting Japanese (or Japanese-French?) films. It isn't something stellar that is likely going to come up as a topic of conversation with anyone, but it's an interesting movie experience.</p>
80267|battleroyale|VCD at home|2002-08-23|<p>When I first heard about this film, I knew that I had to see it. The premise sounded great. And then it became a big controversy in Japan, or at least I heard about it being a controversy. All the more reason to try to get hold of it. Unfortunately, the one time the showed it here in L.A. there was no way I could get to the theater. Tired of waiting around, I decided to get the VCD.</p><p>In fascist Japan (a near future?), unable to deal with the problem of young people, a law is passed, colloquially known as the BR Act. Once a year, a class of ninth graders are taken off to an island. They have three days. Only one person is allowed to come off alive, or they are all killed. That's it.</p><p>On a visual level, this movie is quite brutal, and how can it not be. I guess it actually could have been much worse, since to me it didn't seem too graphic at times. Overall, the film is believable, in that the junior high school students act and react like you would expect them to. While having to deal with the problems thrust onto them by adults, they still also have their own problems, from the petty to the large. With 42 students, it isn't even clear from the beginning of the film who is the \"main character.. This helps, because you pay attention to each of them a little more.</p><p>The interesting thing about this movie isn't teenagers killing teenagers, it is the commentary it makes upon contemporary Japanese society. It looks at the problems of teenagers, but also most importantly the complete detachment between adults and teenagers in that country. Things have really changed in Japan over the last 20 years, and the responsibility that adults once took for the youth is harder and harder to find. In the end, youth are still left to their own devices.</p><p>For anyone with any interest in Japanese society at all, I definitely recommend this film. It is no only fun and interesting, but it can actually get you to think about something a bit deeper.</p>
80268|versus|Egyptian Theatre|2002-08-24|<p>I didn't notice this movie when I first looked through the calendar, but then a coworker pointed it out to me. He said that I had to see it. He'd seen it on video at some point. After reading the description, it didn't really take much to convince me. Where can you go wrong with a zombie yakuza film?</p><p>Two men have escaped from prison and are waiting at a rendezvous point to be picked up. We know things are going to be good when we notice that there is still a severed hand in one of the man's handcuffs. Then the yakuza show up, but they are clearly not prepared to take them away. They've even got a women who they've kidnapped in the car. Prisoner KSC2-303 shoots one of the yakuza and frees the woman, but then the yakuza comes back to life. Shortly thereafter, everyone takes to the woods, and we have yet to meet the yakuza boss who organized this whole thing.</p><p>This is most definitely one of the coolest films I have seen in a very long time. It rocks, non-stop, from beginning to end. The gore special effects are well done, and often provoke laughs. The premise turns out to be very cool. And then there is the fighting. We have guns, we have hand-to-hand, and we have swordplay. It is all very well done, with only one small scene where the didn't remove the wires from the film.</p><p>I really don't want to say anymore about this film. The characters are absolutely hilarious, and you won't be disappointed in having watched this film. It is supposed to be released on video and DVD at some point in the future, perhaps following a short release in the theaters. If you can see it either way, don't pass up the chance.</p>
80269|comrades|DVD at home|2002-08-31|<p>I'd heard of this movie a long time ago, but just never got hold of it. I assumed it was a romance, but didn't know anything about it going in.</p><p>Xiao Jun immigrates into Hong Kong from the mainland. He is able to stay with his aunt, who runs a brothel, while he picks up various odd jobs to start making money. His goal is to make enough money to bring his fiance from his hometown. And then he meets Qiao, who we later find out is also from the mainland, though she tries to deny it as much as possible. The more time they spend with each other, the more they become more than just friends.</p><p>Although the acting and story are quite well done, it was hard for me to  really like this film, since I've been on the wrong end of this mix.  Given that, there really weren't any new concepts for me to pick out of it, only shitty memories that'd I'd rather leave behind me.</p><p>The film is well made, and I'm certain it must have won some awards or something. I cannot recommend the film, though. The messages that really needs to come across (i.e. that if you are an asshole, you should pay for it), gets dodged at the end, so nothing to make me happy.</p>
80270|bigdeal|DVD at home|2002-08-31|<p>A friend told me about this movie recently after I mentioned something about <short=\"rififi\">Rififi</a>. He said that this Italian movie was basically a parody of the aforementioned film. So, given that I've been meaning to see some of the older Italian films for a while, this seemed like as good a place as any to start.</p><p>Peppe, a former boxer, assembles a group to pull of a heist he got word of from a man he was supposed to substitute in prison. The thing is, no one really knows what they are doing. The apartment they have to access turns out to be occupied. Their attempts to do things \"scientificly\" seem to keep falling through.</p><p>The film is fairly funny, though not nearly as side-splitting as I was expecting. There are some really nice ideas that were rather unexpected. When the end comes, though, it doesn't seem quite right. I think it is because the movie doesn't climax in any recognizable way (on purpose).</p><p>The movie is fun, but I wouldn't go around telling everyone to see it. The references to <short=\"rififi\">Rififi</a> aren't so strong, so you don't have to worry about having seen that film first, although I'd highly recommend it on its own.</p>
80271|ichithekiller|VCD at home|2002-09-01|<p>Having heard the name of this film dropped a few times, in particular when talking about Miike, it was only a matter of time before I saw it. When I was inspired to buy several VCDs recently, I managed to get this one for $5, so there isn't much you can go wrong with there.</p><p>Yakuza boss Anjo comes up missing, and his right hand man, Kakihara, is determined to track down the person or persons responsible. Meanwhile, those who sent out Ichi to kill off Anjo won't be happy until the entire group is dead. Meanwhile, we have Ichi who is manipulated to carry out these brutal killings as a means of getting back at bullies in general, having been on  the receiving end of their tricks himself.</p><p>If there is anything that lets you know you are watching a Miike film, it is the graphic violence. Kakihara has his mouth sliced almost ear to ear, literally, and keeps it closed with a pair of piercings. When Ichi goes about his work, you are bound to see plenty of blood and guts flying about. Although it was all too fanciful to affect me, it surely isn't cinema for the faint of heart.</p><p>If you are into this kind of thing, then by all means check it out. For me, it isn't all that much to shout about. The story is interesting as it unfolds, and there are some bizarre scenes which will drop your jaw, but I think most people won't be interested in such a film. If you want to watch a Miike film, I'd recommend <short=\"audition\">Audition</a> first.</p>
80272|titus|DVD at home|2002-09-05|<p>A few friends had seen this film when it was in the theater, but I didn't make it. I generally like Shakespeare, though I cannot always say the same for his adaptations. I hadn't been warned about the film, so I didn't know what to expect (i.e., how much loyalty vs adaptation).</p><p>Upon the death of the emperor, Titus Andronicus is offered the position, but chooses Saturninus instead. The new emperor attempts to take Titus' daughter as a bride, but she is already promised to Bassianus, who later steals off with her. Taking Tamora, the queen of the Goths, as his bride instead, an incessant cycle of destruction and disgrace is heaped upon Titus and his family, until Titus goes mad.</p><p>Not having ever read or seen the play, I don't know how close this stuck to the script, but it seems to have changed little, including language. That's just fine with me, since I get used to the Shakespearean English after listening to it for a bit. The big difference is not the dialogue, it is the visuals. Sometimes the movie is ancient Rome, sometimes roaring 20s, and it takes a while to figure out what is going on visually many times. For me, although I can understand why many of the choices were made, I would have rather had just had the play without the frills. Some of the visual changes are interesting, but many are annoying or confusing.</p><p>The acting in the film is quite good, but the film really relegates itself to an art film with its approach. If you want to see <strong>Titus Andronicus</strong>, then I'd suggest watching out for a local theater company to do it instead. The story is excellent, but for me the visual masturbation of the director just got to be a bit much for me.</p>
80273|hackers|DVD at home|2002-09-06|<p>This film must have come out while I was in Japan, because I never actually heard of it until maybe a year ago. I was reading a list of \"hacker\" films, that started with <short=\"tron\">Tron</a> and ended with <strong>The Matrix</strong>. It sounded decent enough that it might be worth checking out, so it eventually made it through the queue and into my DVD player.</p><p>Dade is arrested by the FBI for creating a virus that brings down several thousand computer systems in 1988, when he is only 11 years old. Jump to 1995, when he is not 18 and legally allowed to touch a computer once again. Also, he's just moved to New York City with his mother to complete his last year of high school in a new school. That's where he meets Kate. As he tries to adjust to the new school, he falls in with a group of hackers. But one of them (the most amateur among them) break into a system where the sys admin is already using a virus and worm to steal from the company, and the kid breaking in provides the perfect opportunity to find a fall guy.</p><p>The films is a high school fantasy film. Realism is not something it is really shooting for. The plot is still interesting and fun, just not believable, and neither are the characters. Although the movie evidences some understanding of computers and networks, they opt for fantasy when they decide to show us a computer monitor. It isn't simply that they don't show us a command line, but that they show us tripped-out 3D graphics of file systems and present the virus and some sort of laser light show of mathematical formulas. On the bright side, the ending involves the activity of an entire community, which is somewhat redeming.</p><p>Unless you are doing research into the representation of hacking and cracking on the big screen, then there really isn't much of a call to see this movie (well, there is Angelina Jolie, but that's not enough for me). It is fun, but essentially a waste of time as far as movies go.</p>
80274|menatwork|DVD at home|2002-09-06|<p>My friend Steve and I watched this a couple times in high school and I remember enjoying it thoroughly then (and thus the reason for watching it more than once). When I was at the store a few weeks ago, I saw that this was out on DVD and that they were asking under $10 for it, so I bought it. I mean, how can you go wrong with a comedy about garbage men?</p><p>Carl and James have been working as garbage collectors for a couple years. They dream of opening up a surf shop in the southern California city of Las Playas, but that hasn't come together yet. If it wasn't bad enough that they are now being forced to do their route with the boss's brother-in-law, they also find a dead body in the trash. For a couple reasons, they decide it isn't a good idea to report this to the police, and end up doing a little investigation of their own.</p><p>Many of the plot elements of the movie are rather weak and beyond the scope of realism, but the movie is still quite enjoyable. There are a number of things throughout that bring out the laughs, a mixture of several different types of humor and jokes. In the end, there really isn't anything extraordinary about this film, but I still enjoy it.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to other people, but not with some great conviction that they \"must\" see the film. It is fun, but ultimately a typical comedy with some interesting situations.</p>
80275|thekiller|DVD at home|2002-09-08|<p>My memory of the few John Woo films I've seen isn't so great. I could vaguely remember ending sequences, but not which title each was associated with. That's why I figured it was about time I went back and watched some of the classics.</p><p>Jeffrey is a hit man who accidentally blinds an innocent woman when trying to escape from a job. Having a sense of honor and responsibility, he makes contact with her six months later to try and make amends and perhaps even help her get the surgery necessary to restore her failing sight. He hopes to pull one last job, and then the two of them will go overseas where it may be easier to get the operation. But two things go wrong. First, a dedicated cop is put on the case to track him down, and second, he is identified by the cops and so the triad boss wants him killed for violating the rules. As the cop tracks him down, he finds that both himself and the killer have much in common.</p><p>This is such a wonderful film and a classic of not just Hong Kong, but cinema in general. The gun fights, appropriately referred to as gun ballet by some, have influenced just about every action film made since. Besides the action, the film is just so wonderfully put together with some excellent actors who capture more than a simple script.</p><p>Everyone with any interest whatsoever in action or Hong Kong films has probably already seen this movie, but if you haven't, slap yourself and go get a copy of it now. It is timeless, and the ending is wonderful (and I don't just mean the amount of ammunition spent in that church, either).</p>
80276|friday|DVD at home|2002-09-15|<p>The primary thing that kept me away from this movie for so long is that I associated it with stoners, which I generally have less than zero respect for. A variety of things got me thinking that it might be worth checking out, and then I came across an article about Ice Cube recently that pushed me over the top.</p><p>Craig, 22 years old and living with his parents, wakes up on Friday with no job, no money, and no milk for his cereal. With little to do, he ends up spending most of the day on the front porch with Smokey, who spends all of his time high. Problem is, Smokey is supposed to be selling the pot, not smoking it, and Big Worm wants either the goods or the money by the end of the day, or else. With death looming over there heads, the two have to figure out what they're going to do.</p><p>I really liked this film, a lot more than I expected. Although I thought the father was a bit over-acted, everything else comes across nicely. A lot of the humor revolves around simple, everyday things taking place in the ghetto. And, of course, pot smoking isn't nearly as pervasive as I was afraid it would be. The main character doesn't even smoke. The crown jewel of the film is it ending. I really got into the climax, sitting up in my seat to cheer Craig on.</p><p>This is a genuinely great film. I think I could recommend it to just about anyone, especially given that there is more beneath the surface that set-ups for a joke or two.</p>
80277|wagthedog|DVD at home|2002-09-16|<p>I don't know why I missed this film when it was in the theaters, the film is really right up my alley. I mean, how often does a political film come out of Hollywood. Just about never. And to boot, the film was clearly quite adept at depicting the political process in this country. Well, given the current state of events, with a White House make up blatant lies in order to drive us into a real war, it seemed only appropriate to finally watch the film.</p><p>With just two weeks before the presidential elections, the incumbent knows that on the following day a scandal about a sexual indiscretion between himself and an underage girl is about to break. So what do you do. You call in Conrad Brean, a most competent man at manipulating the political landscape. He in turn enlists Motss, a Hollywood producer. Their goal. A simple bait-and-switch with the American public. Create a war in order to draw their attention away from the scandal and get the president re-elected.</p><p>Of course, truth is always stranger than fiction. Shortly after the release of the film, Clinton was embroiled in sexual scandals, to which he responded by increasing the bombing of Iraq (because, remember, the bombing has not stopped since 1991). Of course, the Iraq example can go back further, when in order to motivate the population behind an attack on Iraq in 1991, Bush brought in a Kuwaiti woman to claim that she had witness atrocities when in fact she had not set foot in the country since long before the supposed events took place.</p><p>In any case, this film still does a wonderful job of portraying the way in which politics in this country is mostly about manipulating the population to further other aims. It doesn't offer a very hopeful view of people on that level, which I would disagree with. The other problem is that in this situation they are deceiving for simple political gain, when in reality most of the manipulation takes place to further more concrete economic and political goals.</p><p>This film is a must see for everyone. It is now are firm part of American culture to the point that people can call forth for the tail to wag the dog so that we CAN go to war. There aren't any answers in the film (it is Hollywood, remember), but there are plenty of truths.</p>
80278|bluecrush|Pacific Beach Cities 16|2002-09-20|<p>This movie had a pretty pervasive ad campaign. I remember seeing the trailer a couple months before the movie came out, and at least a month before the film hit the theaters posters, billboards, etc. were everywhere with the ad. My first impression from the trailer was positive, in particular I noted how all of the women in the film appeared to be real women. What I mean is that given the fact that most of the actresses were going to be running around in bikinis for most of the flick, I didn't see an excess of boob jobs. Instead, the women looked like people who could actually get onto a surfboard without hurting themselves. In any case, instead of heading to a bar, a friend and I decided to check this out instead. He'd already seen the film, but since he took up surfing recently (before the film came out) he wanted to see it again, especially since it portrayed women in a positive and affirming role.</p><p>Anne Marie has been invited to participate in a surf contest, one of only two amateurs invited, but is still facing a good deal of fear since she almost drowned three years earlier at the same contest. Meanwhile, she has to take care of her younger sister, Penny, since their mother has long since disappeared with a boyfriend. Together with her friends Eden and Lena, they work as maids at a luxury hotel, trying to make ends meet so they can do what they really enjoy, which is surf. As the contest approaches, Anne Marie still isn't so sure of herself, and then gets involved with a mainlander in town on vacation.</p><p>I enjoyed the movie, though for me most of the relationship parts got a bit tedious. Most of the characters are likable and believable, especially Eden, who just rocks. On top of all this, there are truly amazing surfing shots. I won't claim to know anything about camera work, but they did an excellent job and got shots that I cannot begin to imaging how they pulled off. But the most important aspect of the film was that it was about women who could get by on their own. This is such an important aspect because the way women are portrayed in most films is absolutely sickening.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to other people. Especially considering that this was a summer movie, which are typically vacuous, this is one of the better examples of summer movies to come out of Hollywood.</p>
80279|mancalledhero|VCD at home|2002-09-22|<p>I know I came across this film for the first time when I was looking into actors and actresses after watching another film. It would hit my radar every now and then after that. When I was looking through for VCDs to buy, this one was discounted, so I ordered it, figuring that it wouldn't be half bad.</p><p>Hero leaves home to study martial arts, but while he is away his family is slaughtered. He hears the dying words of his mother, who indicates who it was that killed everyone. He then makes quick work of that guy, but then has to flee. He journeys to the United States where he must work in a mine under slave labor conditions for a while, before escaping. He is shortly rejoined by his wife and friend, but when a fire destroys the building they are in after his wife gives birth, a soothsayer says that he was born under a star of death and so he decides to separate from his children so that they will not die simply because he is around.</p><p>This is a fun movie, with some pretty cool special effects. The fight sequences concentration on these special effect, culminating in a final fight scene atop the Statue of Liberty. Sometimes the plot is a bit hard to follow and understand, and I cannot be sure if this is because of the subtitles or the story itself. For example, his daughter is kidnapped and that issue is never resolved in the film. I can only assume that there must have been some explanation in the Cantonese dialogue, but it wasn't in the English.</p><p>There is nothing spectacular about this film that merits everyone rushing out to see it. If you enjoyed <strong>Storm Riders</strong>, you'll probably like this film as it has a very similar flavor (is it a sequel?). Otherwise, this isn't a movie to cut your teeth on.</p>
80280|ronin|DVD at home|2002-09-23|<p>I'd heard of this movie when it came out, but didn't pay much attention to it. My officemate and I were talking about movies and he suggested this film to me. A few days later, he just lent me his own copy, so here we are.</p><p>Several former agents of one government or another are hired to do a job. Among them is Sam, a former CIA agent. In Nice, they are supposed to steal a case before the current owner can sell it to the Russians. There are still a lot of questions though, such as what is in the case, who exactly they are working for, etc.</p><p>The movie is quite fun, with an interesting plot that doesn't give itself away too soon. The one thing that really stands out is the car chases. There was one point while I was watching that I actually mentioned to my roommate that they clearly spent the bulk of their budget on the car chases. Nobody does them better than Hollywood, and these take the cake. On top of all this, Robert De Niro's Sam is just a really cool character that is easy to get behind. He has things together in a way that we could all strive for, the  legality of the situation be damned.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film to action fans. You aren't going to learn anything about yourself by watching this film, but you won't feel like you've wasted your time either. Definitely a couple hours well spent.</p>
80281|lordjim|Egyptian Theatre|2002-09-26|<p>I knew that Joseph Conrad has written a book by this name, but I hadn't realized there had been a movie made of it until I was looking through the calendar of upcoming movies. As a result, I was inspired to start reading the book (though I didn't finish it quite before I saw the movie). I think that <strong>Heart of Darkness</strong> is one of the greatest English language works of literature, so I was looking forward to this, especially given the great review it got and that it was being shown in 70mm.</p><p>Jim, from a better-off background, enters a life on the ocean in the seas of southern Asia. After an injury, he signs on as first mate of the Patna, a ship carrying 800 Muslims on their way to Mecca. Not far into the journey, they hit something, and with a terrible storm coming, the rest of the crew panics and jumps ship before it goes down. But it doesn't. Jim admits to his cowardice in court (everyone else runs away), and then searches for a way to redeem his romantic soul. The opportunity comes when a German merchant asks for his help in delivering guns and powder to a village in Thailand that is under the thumb of a general.</p><p>The story told in the movie and that told in the book are quite different.  In the end, they are tales about two different things, the book emphasizing the ignorant romanticism of the elite, while the movie concentrates on the politics and situation a poor people are in. The book also takes place on an isolated island in what is now eastern Indonesia, and Jim is not sent to \"free\" a subjected people but to disappear from his dishonor. In the end, I like the film a little better because of the messages that come across, but still think that the book is excellent at doing what it sets out to do. Oh, one theory why they switched the location (besides ease of filming), is that they didn't want to associate the movie too strongly with <strong>Lawrence of Arabia</strong>.</p><p>The acting is pretty good throughout, and the story progresses in an interesting fashion (though I have to say the reaction of the woman at the end make more sense and is must more appropriate in the book). In particular, I loved the general, who has some of the best lines. His astute analysis of people and politics is refreshing in a movie.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to other people. As I've already pointed out the major differences between the book and the movie, it should be clear that it isn't necessary to read it before sitting down to enjoy the movie. They don't really make movies like this anymore.</p>
80282|thetuxedo|The Bridge, Howard Hughes Plaza|2002-10-05|<p>Well, all you need to say is that there is a new Jackie Chan film (a real new one, and not a dubbing and re-release of an older film), and I'll be there. I'm almost ashamed that I didn't go see this on the first weekend that it came out, but I've been too busy lately. I didn't even really see much in the way of trailers for this, although the one I did see didn't impress me.</p><p>Jimmy Tong is a cab driver (in New York City, I think, though I thought it was Toronto until near the end of the film). He's known for been quite fast, but also efficient, so he gets hired to drive around a secret agent (although he, of course, does not know this at first). When that agent is hospitalized from an injury, for some unfathomable reason he tells Jimmy to put on his tuxedo, which is actually an advanced piece of machinery that enables the wearer to do any of a number of tricks without actually having the ability before hand. He then hooks up with another agent who doesn't realize who he really is, and they set about uncovering the malevolent plans of a water baron.</p><p>Well, I read one review that said this was Jackie Chan's worst Hollywood film (I assume he was only counting from the 90s on). I have to agree. There are some serious problems here. First there are some really lame characters. Hewitt's character is mostly annoying, certainly inconsistent, and has some horrible lines. Actually, the whole script was lacking. The plot's pretty weak too, and really not acceptable for a Chan film. And then tack on the annoying special effects, such that the final fight scene wasn't all that great to watch. I was also annoyed by the tuxedo at times, some of the things it was supposed to do, particularly when Jackie first puts it on.</p><p>Now that that is out of the way, I still liked the film. I'm not going to buy it on DVD, but it was fun and there were still some of the tell-tale elements that make Jackie's films enjoyable.</p><p>This is a movie for Jackie Chan fans, and that's about it. I don't think a lot of other people will really like it (and I'm sure many fans are annoyed at it).</p>
80283|hardboiled|DVD at home|2002-10-06|<p>I haven't seen this film since I was probably in high school or the first couple years of college. All I really remembered was the scene in the maternity ward of the hospital at the end. I've been planning to catch up on some of the old John Woo films, as well as Chow Yun-Fat's films, and since this movie is out of print now, I figured I should get my hands on it sooner rather than later.</p><p>Tequila is a cop trying to bring down the triads, when his partner is shot down in a tea-house shoot-out. The problem is, he soons starts bunting heads against an undercover cop (unbeknownst to him at first) who is working to bring down the organization from within. As they come closer to uncovering the stash of guns the boss has been hiding, both of their positions become harding to handle, and they eventually are drawn together.</p><p>This movie is classic, a farewell picture before Woo left for Hollywood. Unlike many of his other films, where meaty themes are much more prominent, this film just shoots for over-the-top. In the end, it does an excellent job of that. The mix of comedy with gunplay is superb, and this film has had an influence on ALL action movies made since</p><p>If you haven't seen this film yet, get ahold of it as soon as you can. Probably at some point in the future they will release it again on DVD, but for now you'd have to settle for $100 copies of the <a href=\"http://www.criterionco.com\" title=\"Criterion Collection\">Criterion</a> edition if you wanted to own it (actually, I got hold of another company's edition, but why waste your money). This is a classic, must-see for any true fan of action films.</p>
80284|taxidriver|DVD at home|2002-10-09|<p>Sometimes I just get in the mood to watch this film, which I consider to be one of the greatest movies of all times. I've seen it a number of times since I first saw in my first year in college, including once on the big screen with an intro from a couple people in the film (including the guy who played Wizard, Peter Boyle). On this screening, I got to introduce my roommate to the film, since she'd never seen it.</p><p>Travis is a 26-year-old ex-marine in New York City. He cannot sleep nights, so he takes a job driving a taxi. He drives anyone, anywhere. He is disgusted by the filth of the city and knows that something has to be done about it. A woman working in the campaign office of a candidate for president catches his eye, and he invites her for coffee. After a faux pas, however, she doesn't want to talk to him anymore. That's when he really meets Iris, a girl working as a prostitute who clearly isn't happy with the life she leads, but doesn't really think she can get out of it.</p><p>How can you not like a movie that inspired John Hinkley to try to assassinate Ronald Reagan in order to impress Jodie Foster. The acting in this film is superb, and for people only familiar with De Niro's later roles, his physique will come as a bit of a surprise. He's a guy who sees the problems of this society but has no idea what he can do to begin addressing them. His attempts to relate to people are rebuffed, and the genuine honestly that De Niro gets across is absolutely amazing. And then, there is the ending which is just... inspirational.</p><p>Like I said, this is one of the greatest movies ever made. Go out and get it, buy it, and watch it every so often.</p>
80285|thetransporter|United Artists Theater in Marina Del Rey|2002-10-13|<p>When I first saw the trailer for this film, I figured I would be in the theater to watch it. First off, we have Luc Besson writing and producing it. Then there is Corey Yuen, who has done some amazing and inventive work in Hong Kong. Add in a lead actor who has done good work, and then the cherry on the top, Shu Qi. What could possibly go wrong with this film. And it got decent reviews (for an action film).</p><p>Frank Martin is an American living in Nice. With his military background and a few simple rules, he hires out as a transporter, someone who will carry anything, anywhere, for the right price, no questions asked about the package. But then the latest package starts making noise in his trunk, and despite his rules, he opens the package. But when the recipient tries to kill him, he finds it is time to break some more rules.</p><p>This is great, over-the-top action, pure and simple. The fight scenes are very creative and an utter pleasure to watch. There is really only one time in the film when my suspension of disbelief was pushed too far, and that was when Frank skydives. Don't go to this film expecting anything complicated, but I think it maintains a consistency that will suit any true action fan.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film to people who enjoy good action films. People who get hung up on realism or complex plots aren't going to have fun, but then they probably never have much fun anyway.</p>
80286|frombeijingwithlove|DVD at home|2002-10-13|<p>Well, I had attempted to watch this movie a couple weeks earlier, and was just too tired and slept through all but the first five minutes. I generally like Chow's work, and figured a pan of the James Bond and spy genres would  be quite enjoyable. It was just a matter of finding the time and motivation to watch it.</p><p>Ling Ling Chai (which is Cantonese for 007) is an agency reject who's file is about to be burned along with other 10-year-old records when the director decides to put him on the case of a stolen dinosaur head. The reason, of course, is because the director himself was behind the theft. He then sets his assistant off to assassinate Chai. Chai has been working as a butcher,  and his skill with a knife is without peer, but his skills with a firearm leave much to be desired.</p><p>This is a fairly lackluster piece from Chow. There are definitely times in the movie that you'll laugh, but a lot of the humor is more annoying or just unfunny than anything else. If you are looking for a good parody of spy films, there are certainly better places to look.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film even to a serious Stephen Chow fan. It isn't so bad that I hated it, it just wasn't worth watching. It has helped convince me that I shouldn't grab movies just because they have an actor or director that I like, especially when coming out of Hong Kong.</p>
80287|400blows|DVD at home|2002-10-13|<p>I have to say that I've heard of this film in various contexts, but never really knew what it was about or why it was considered to be a classic. Taking note of the fact that the disc is now out of print, it made sense to get hold of it now while it was still relatively easy. Of course, I had it sitting around the house for over a month before I finally got in the mood to watch it.</p><p>Antoine Doinel is a thirteen year old boy in Paris. Nothing is all that great for him. He gets punished for something he didn't do in class, and then when he is dumb enough to write on the walls that he will get revenge upon the teacher, he gets punished for that as well. Home life isn't much better, with a mother who doesn't particularly care for him. When he skips school with a friend and doesn't have a note the next day, he tells the teacher that his mother died. When his parents find out he played hookey and show up at the school, he gets in even more trouble. The logical thing is to just not go home after that.</p><p>Apparently the film is semi-autobiographical, and there are other films that the director made after this that take Antoine forward through his life. The acting is superb, particularly the young boy who plays Antoine. There aren't really any uplifting moments in the film, though. Although I thought the film was well crafted, I definitely couldn't convince someone that they should see it. It is a one-time film that probably will appeal more to the  serious art crowd or those with historical interest in film.</p><p>Although the movie was well done, I cannot recommend it to other people. I don't regret having watched it, there just isn't anything about it that makes me want to spread the word.</p>
80288|rapedbyanangel|DVD at home|2002-10-17|<p>I'm never quite sure what to make of a Hong Kong film that has at least half a dozen sequels. Given the title of this film, it would be easy to understand why there were so many. But, it is also billed as a sequel to <strong>Naked Killer</strong>, which was a fun film that had virtually no nudity in it. I figured it was worth a try, although it has gotten quite mixed reviews.</p><p>Yau is a law student and a TV commercial spokesmodel. But then a psychotic lawyer with extensive rape fantasies determines that he is going to have sex with her. But he first decides to go through her friend and roommate. When he gets away with that, it is time for revenge.</p><p>I actually thought the whole rape set-up was quite creative and really  tells you something about the way laws and courtrooms work in real life. The down side, of course, was the rape, although it wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been. The revenge was interesting, but I have to say that the ending wasn't as satisfying as it could have been.</p><p>I don't think I'd recommend this film to anyone, but it was still interesting. Some of the acting is trying at times, but it is hard to complain about Chingmy.</p>
80289|iris|DVD at home|2002-10-18|<p>Other than knowing the movie was nominated for a number of awards, I wasn't really clear on what it was about. I probably heard the Alzheimer's part of it somewhere along the line, but I didn't know who Iris Murdock was before watching the film. My roommates rented it, so I watched it.</p><p>The movie jumps back and forth from the aging Iris, who is beginning to show the signs of Alzheimer's, to the Iris of her youth when she met her husband. Throughout, we see the kind of intellectual that Iris was, devoted to her writing and to education. Meanwhile, we see the pain and sorrow of those around her and herself as she begins to forget the very thing that mattered to her the most</p><p>While the layout of the film is done well and the acting is absolutely top-notch, I wasn't overly moved by the film. I guess I have seen enough about Alzheimer's that that aspect of the film didn't reveal anything new to me, and since I've never read any of Iris' books, I didn't have that connection to the film. In the end, I wasn't bowled over, but wasn't annoyed at having watched it either.</p><p>I wouldn't really recommend this film to anyone unless they were a fan of Iris as an author, but in that case they have probably seen the movie already anyway.</p>
80290|3strikes|DVD at home|2002-10-21|<p>I wanted to see this movie after I saw the trailer, given that it was a movie that had the potential to address a pretty serious issue here in California. The reviews for the movie, however, were awful, and I was never able to convince anyone to go see it. Eventually, a friend saw it on video and told me that it was decent, so I stuck it back in my head as a movie to see.</p><p>Rob Douglas is about to get out of prison, and he hopes to stay out this time. He has some extra incentive, since he already has two strikes against him, and a third strike means a minimum sentence of 25 to life. But when Rob gets picked up from jail in a stolen car and the driver shortly thereafter get into a gunfight with CHP, things are not looking good.</p><p>This movie is funny at moments, but isn't consistent. There are a lot of things that could have been built upon, but weren't. The acting didn't really impress me either, though I did like Brian Hooks. As for the political issues, it doesn't really come through as well as it could there either. I still enjoyed the movie, and didn't feel like I wasted my time, but I can understand why most people could do without seeing it.</p><p>You could do without seeing this film. It is enjoyable, and if you are familiar with the other work of the people in and behind it, perhaps that will tell you what to expect, just tamed down.</p>
80291|highnoon|DVD at home|2002-10-21|<p>My dad used to watch various westerns when I was a kid, but I cannot honestly say I remember any of them. It was really a review of Clint Eastwood's early material several years ago that convinced me that there were probably quite a few westerns out there worth watching. And, if that is the case, this is probably one of the most famous and therefore worth checking out.</p><p>Will Kane is getting married, and although it will be another day before the new sheriff arrives in town, he is retiring. Why. Because his new wife is a quaker who abhors violence. But then word comes down that Frank Miller has been released from prison, and three of his cronies are already at the train station waiting for him to arrive. Kane knows that there is no escaping this, if he runs like his wife wants him to, Miller will just find him and cause trouble later. But no one in town is willing to stand by Kane's side with  the showdown coming.</p><p>I wasn't completely bowled over like I expected to be (so maybe my expectations were too high), but this is still a darn good movie. The plot is simple and the set-up is quite realistic. The acting is pretty good, though I didn't find Cooper to be the most impressive.</p><p>If you are even considering watching westerns, this is one that has to be checked out. I don't advocate going out and buying it, but it is worth watching.</p>
80292|loveonadiet|DVD at home|2002-10-26|<p>I am sure that this movie made it onto my list from one of two direction, either I noticed that Johnny To was the director or that Sammi Cheng was the actress. I think I then came across decent reviews of it, since looking at it on the surface it had the potential to be a very annoying movie.</p><p>Mini developed a serious weight problem after her Japanese boyfriend went to the U.S. to study music. After ten years, they both still long for each other, but Mini is afraid to confront him in her current condition. Enter Andy's character, identified only as \"Fatso,\" who also has a weight problem, but isn't so concerned about it. After helping out Mini, since they are both from Hong Kong, he cannot get rid of her. It isn't long before he is pledged to helping Mini return to her former weight.</p><p>This movie is pretty funny and didn't come across as offensive, as I was afraid it might. I cannot say that it was terribly realistic, but it wasn't bent so far as to make me moan. The make up was done fairly well, though sometimes the hands or creases didn't look very natural. The ending is, of course, quite predictable, but then it wouldn't be a romantic comedy if it wasn't.</p><p>This is a must for any Sammi fans. Other than that, it is enjoyable, but not such a stellar movie than non-Hong Kong film fans should go out and grab it.</p>
80293|frequency|DVD at home|2002-11-04|<p>I'm generally not a big Dennis Quaid fan, which is probably the first thing that kept me from paying any attention to this movie when it came out. I would have never had any interest at all if I hadn't got hold of the Korean movie, <short=\"ditto\">Ditto</a>, which builds upon a similar concept, although it isn't the same kind of film.</p><p>In 1999, John Sullivan makes contact over a Ham radio with his father in 1969. Realizing that his father is going to die shortly thereafter, an event that marred John's childhood, he warns his father of the incident that takes his life. When history is changed, it isn't simply that his father lives another twenty years, but that his mother ends up dying as a result. The father and son have a week to solve a serial murder case before the murderer takes the life of his mother.</p><p>The movie was enjoyable and made it easy for the viewer to get involved in the plot. The sci-fi aspect is fairly muted, though there are interesting documentaries on the DVD to explain the basis upon which they built it. The time travel aspect is interesting as well, though the whole \"remembering both\" situation steps outside what I would want to see in a real sci-fi film, although some of it is necessary for the plot. The last bit of 1969 affecting 1999, however, was annoying, even if the effect was well done.</p><p>This movie isn't stellar, but fun to watch nonetheless. I wouldn't tell anyone that they need to see the film, but I also wouldn't warn anyone away from it if they still wanted to see it.</p>
80294|heat|DVD at home|2002-11-05|<p>Yet another movie that I missed because I was out of the country in 1995-96. for the most part, those movies have been no big loss, but occasionally there are film that people tell me about that I want to see. My officemate lent me this after we had a discussion about De Niro. It took me a while to find the time to watch it, but I figured it would be worth it.</p><p>A group of thieves rob an armored car, but the new guy guns one of the guards down, leaving them with no choice but to kill everyone. Before they can dismiss him, he gets away. To boot, when they attempt to sell the bonds they nabbed back to the owner, he tries to doublecross them. On top of all this, Vincent Hanna of the LAPD is determined to track them down and foil their next robbery. But Neil McCauley is no amateur and nailing them will be difficult.</p><p>Weighing it at almost three hours, this film feels long at times but still feels worth it in the end. I had trouble realizing who the \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" were, at times, since De Niro's character was for me the most respectable character in the film. Pacino's character, however, comes across quite well, too, and believable. In particular, I loved the final things he has to say to his wife.</p><p>This is good film, and worth watching for anyone who enjoys the genre. The action scene didn't blow me away, but everything came across as believable and the story was one you just wanted to follow through to the end. I would recommend this to most people.</p>
80295|bloodfordracula|DVD at home|2002-11-09|<p>This got into my queue because it is put out by <a href=\"http://www.criterionco.com\" title=\"Criterion Collection\">Criterion</a>. I'm slowly learning that that may not be enough for a movie to be worthwhile. Or rather, that it may not be enough for me to think that the movie is as good as art critics do. This one sounded fun, though, since it was supposed to be a humorous horror story.</p><p>The Dracula family is dying off, and Count Dracula needs to leave Romania to find some virgin blood, since there are apparently no virgins in Romania anymore. So, he decides to head to Italy, a good Catholic country where virginity is still prized (uh, yeah, sure). After being invited to stay in the run-down villa of a family with four unmarried daughters, it seems the Count may be in for some good luck. But their impurities with the gardener, not to mention the gardener himself, could prove to be more troublesome than expected.</p><p>This movie is campy, and if that is your kind of movie, then check it out. For me, however, I'm realizing that I just don't enjoy campy movies like I used to. There are some truly funny scenes in the movie, like when Dracula tastes impure blood for the first time and when he has his final showdown. Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect for me was Dracula's assistant, whose facial expressions and general demeanor really were the highlight of the movie. Everything else about the film, however, was quite unappealing. The sex scenes are tiresome, and the attempts at political conversation make it clear that the people behind the film had their heads firmly planted in their rear-ends.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film, and in fact, as a result of watching this film I have pulled a number of other movies from my queue. If they are on par with this movie, then I really don't want to waste my time watching them.</p>
80296|touchofevil|DVD at home|2002-11-10|<p>I had heard of this film a long, long time ago, but never saw it. I think this is partly due to the fact that I've only recently become more attracted to older cinema. I knew, however, that Orson Welles was reliable, and with a title like this, how could it not be a good movie.</p><p>Mexican police official Vargas has just gotten married to an American. On their honeymoon night, a bomb explodes near the border where they are, and Vargas quickly becomes involved in what is going on. North of the border, a crooked cop appears to be framing an innocent man, while the brother of someone Vargas is set to testify against is determined to bring grief to Vargas. His beautiful, blonde wife is an obvious target for bringing him down.</p><p>I watched a version of the film which was re-edited about ten years ago to more closely match notes that Welles left after the studio butchered his film. Since I've never seen the original, I don't know what the difference was, but this version is quite enjoyable to watch. The twists and turns are excellent, and Orson's role as the corrupt cop is wonderful. Although not completely convincing as a Mexican, Heston does an excellent job as well.</p><p>I don't have a lot more to say about the movie. It is definitely worth watching, and anyone serious about film has probably already seen it.</p>
80297|bowlingforcolumbine|Arts Theater in Long Beach|2002-11-15|<p>I was hesitant to see this movie. I know that Michael Moore can be funny at times, and I really like <strong>Roger and Me</strong>. I also know, however, that politically he doesn't have anything much to offer in the way of solutions, so many times he can just be moralistic and annoying. When the subject matter of the movie is guns in the U.S., I felt fairly certain that he would be taking a different perspective from me and thus was hesitant to hear him drone on about it. Enough friends, however, saw it to recommend that it had enough good qualities to sit through, so a few of us finally went to see it.</p><p>The movie combines interviews, stock footage, some cartoons, and an occasional marketing video to explore the issue of guns in the United States. It attempts to go through many of the arguments that are put out there as to why the U.S. has such a love affair with guns and why there are so many gun deaths each year. Statistics are balanced against an exploration of the different circumstances under which violence has occurred in this country, particularly that carried out by youths as in Columbine.</p><p>The movie does a good job of bringing out the issues, and in the end I felt that it didn't over push the viewer into Moore's perspective. This isn't to say that it isn't there, but that someone who disagrees can still watch the movie and get a lot out of it. It is very insightful that he draws the connection between Littleton, Colorado as not only the home of the Columbine massacre, but also as the home of Lockheed Martin, the world's largest producer of \"weapons of mass destruction.. Although he doesn't so strongly draw the connection later in the film, it should not be ignored that the U.S. government is the largest bully in the world and solves many of its problems through violence. Just an hour after the announcement of the largest single day of bombing against Kosovo, Clinton got on national TV to say that we should learn to solve our problems without the use of violence. Irony?</p><p>There are many things in the film to make you laugh. The cartoon put together by the makers of <strong>South Park</strong> that gives a brief history of the U.S. is excellent. The clip from the marketing video of a company that sells metal detectors to schools was what really brought me to tears with laughter. And then there are the scenes to make you think. One of the best interviews is with Marilyn Manson, who when asked what he would say to the kids who carried out the Columbine massacre if they were here today says, that he wouldn't say anything, but would instead listen to them.</p><p>There is, of course, some crap in the film as well. The movie ends on a very pathetic note, and Moore's attitude towards Charlton Heston is just disrespectful and unnecessary. I'm no fan of the NRA, but the sequence just had no point. I was also left sceptical of some of his treatments, particularly the way he deals with Canada.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film to other people. There are problems with it, but there is also an incredibly good deal of information. Don't see this movie alone, because it really needs to be discussed afterwards. That's its true value.</p>
80298|sweetsixteen|ArcLight Hollywood|2002-11-16|<p>I'd gotten the schedule for the <a href=\"http://www.afi.com/AFIFEST/2002/\" title=\"AFI Fest\">AFI Fest</a> a while back, but didn't see anything that caught my eye. I think this was due in part to the horrible format and me being too lazy to read through everything. Anyway, a friend of mine brought the new Ken Loach film to my attention, so I had to go see it. Loach is one of the few directors I feel I can count on to always make a good film.</p><p>Liam is fifteen and his mother is in prison. He has hopes and illusions that when she gets out, just days before his sixteenth birthday, that they can start to be a \"real\" family together. His mother, a former heroin addict, is still with a boyfriend who is a dealer. Liam knows that as long as she stays with him, she's stuck, so he works to try to buy a place for them. With a goal in mind, he and his friend get hold of some drugs and sell them, making some good money, but they still need more to afford the caravan. In this former shipbuilding city in Scotland, there aren't really any other options besides drugs.</p><p>This is a great movie, and really gets to the heart of why Loach is such a good director. He is able to depict the daily lives of ordinary working people and the difficulties they go through without being preachy or moralistic. Liam, despite the reality of what he is doing, is a very likable character who we want to succeed. The situation he is in, however, doesn't leave a lot of realistic options.</p><p>I recommend this film highly. I'm sure it will get a limited release here in the U.S. later in the art houses, Loach's films always do. If you have the chance to see it near you, check it out.</p>
80299|uprising|DVD at home|2002-11-17|<p>This was a made-for-TV movie, which would explain why there was no chance of me seeing it before, not even having an antenna. The fact that they made a movie about the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, however, was certain to get my attention. I know that it is ultimately Hollywood behind the camera, so they aren't going to go into the political issues of the time period as well as they could be explored (there are some good books for this), but at least they try, right?</p><p>Shortly after Germany defeats Poland in 1939, the Jews are rounded up and put into a ghetto in the capital of Warsaw. Conditions are made worse and worse, from the inability to even get bread to the cramped living conditions. People who die are left in the streets. And then the ghetto starts to get evacuated, people taken off to Treblinka to be put in the ovens. After the vast majority of the ghetto's residents are already gone, those that remain are finally able to organize enough people to fight back. They don't expect to live, although there is the vague hope that the Allies might step in, but they certainly would rather have control over their own deaths and go down fighting, rather than butchered in some distant camp.</p><p>As expected, the film does its best to not offend anyone. There is even a documentary on the bonus disc to explain that everyone resisted \"in their own way.. For example, the head of the Jewish Council is depicted in a fairly positive light, someone who really thought that by cooperating with the NAZIs he was saving lives. The ultimate reality of the circumstances, unfortunately, is that the early you fight back and organize, the less people will die.</p><p>The movie really concentrates on the fighting, and these parts are drawn out fairly extensively. This is not to say that they aren't well done or accurate, but that this is really the tack that a Hollywood production is going to take. There is some history to be learned here, which is always a good thing, and the production and acting is fairly good all around.</p><p>This isn't the greatest thing ever put to film, but for network television, I wouldn't expect things to get much better than this. I cannot say it is necessarily worth watching it now, especially given that it is quite long, but if the subject matter interests you, then definitely check it out.</p>
80300|primalfear|DVD at home|2002-11-19|<p>With Richard Gere as the leading actor in this film, it isn't much of a wonder why I didn't pay any attention to this film when it came out. To add on top of that that it is something of a lawyer/courtroom drama, that's usually not the kind of thing I go in for. But a friend of mine saw it a while back and really liked it. I've been very pleased with Edward Norton's work, so I rented it.</p><p>When the arch-bishop is murdered in Chicago, Aaron is picked up running away from the scene covered in blood. Defense attorney, Martin Vail, immediately offers to take the case pro bono. Aaron pleads his innocence, but everyone is screaming for blood. As Vail begins to research the case, more and more dirt comes up about the arch-bishop, and more and more people have motive for having him killed.</p><p>This is an engrossing film that is worth every minute, particularly in light of all the recent uproar about sexual abuse and the Catholic church. Also particularly relevant her is that next to none of these priests in real life is being prosecuted, but instead the Church is being allowed to handle it. In this movie, we get to see the inner workings of the government and the church and how these things play out in a realistic forum. And then the ending is just the icing on the cake for an already intelligent film.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film to everyone. The combination of real politics with the murder mystery and courtroom drama come together about as well as I would ever expect them to. This is Norton's first film, but it is already clear how excellent of an actor he is.</p>
80301|shallowhal|DVD at aunt's house|2002-11-23|<p>I wasn't sure what to make of this film when it was released. I heard some good things about it from coworkers, but not enough to make me want to see it in the theaters. I had figured at that point I'd wait till it came out on DVD. When I was looking for movies to watch at my Aunt's house, this one was an easy first target.</p><p>Hal is extremely shallow in what he looks for in women, a trait he picked up from his dying father. Given Hal's looks and personality, however, he isn't quite suited for the women he keeps aiming for. One day he gets trapped on an elevator for hours with a motivational speaker, who is able to magically give Hal the ability to see women for their inner beauty instead of their exterior. Immediately, he starts running in to highly attractive women who actually seem interested in him. But can he handle it when the power is taken away thanks to his \"friend?\"</p><p>As I had heard hinted at in the reviews and comments of my peers, this is a surprisingly sympathetic film. My greatest surprise was that the final outcome did not involve everyone getting a physical makeover so that they could look like supermodels and be happy with their lives (see <short=\"loveonadiet\">Love on a Diet</a> for that unsettling, but typical, approach). The movie itself is fairly funny and near believable at times. There are even decent messages about life and relationships buried in there.</p><p>As far as modern comedies go, this one is pretty good. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes light American fare.</p>
80302|whatwomenwant|DVD at aunt's house|2002-11-24|<p>The concept of this film intrigued me when it came out, particularly when I saw that it was directed by a woman. I heard too many bad things about it, though, when it hit the theaters, so I never went to see it. As with many of the films watched during this week, my resistance is brought down incredibly when spending time in Ohio.</p><p>Nick Marshall is in advertising, and he is quite good at appealing to base male instincts, as he is a rather base male himself. Then the boss brings in a new woman (into a position Nick had hoped to be promoted into), to get the company into markets that appeal to women, since that is where they are losing their market share. On top of this, Nick's daughter, who he's never taken an interest in, is stuck with him for several weeks while the ex-wife goes on her honeymoon. One night, a bit of electricity turns this male chauvinist into a telepath, able to read the thoughts of all females. After overcoming the shock of what other people actually think about him, he quickly starts using this ability to undermine his female boss as well as to pick up on more and more women.</p><p>The film turns out to be fairly interesting and funny. It really doesn't come as much of a surprise, but things flow well and I found myself sympathetic to the character involved. As far as romantic comedies goes, I've seen much, much worse. The scene I enjoyed the most was the sex scene with Marisa Tomei (my own fantasies about her aside), because it really points out the problem with sex. Most men don't know what women want sexually, but women also don't bother to tell me, just moan and complain about it internally or to other women. It is a sorry commentary on our society that this only comes about because this guy can actually read the woman's mind.</p><p>This movie really isn't necessary viewing, but if you are looking for a movie to watch as a couple, it will definitely suit the bill (wish I'd been so lucky).</p>
80303|roadtrip|DVD at aunt's house|2002-11-24|<p>I have to admit that this is a movie I never thought I'd see. I'm not sure why it even got my attention while perusing through my aunt and uncle's DVDs. I guess the premise of a road trip was partially appealing, though I have to admit that most of my road trips took place in high school, and not in college as in this film. I generally avoid this kind of fare, since it is about and appeals to the kinds of people I never was.</p><p>Josh has been with his girlfriend since almost infancy, but the strain of college is starting to get to them both since they are going to schools quite distant from each other. The girlfriend has already made the choice to start sleeping with other guys and is putting Josh off, but the dummy doesn't get it. Then one night he meets Beth, who he hits it off with and they end the night with a romp which she videotapes. When that video gets sent to the girlfriend by mistake, a road trip ensues to intercept the tape (since the girlfriend has claimed that her grandfather died, and so theoretically isn't going to be around). Most of the movie is along the way.</p><p>Luckily, Tom Green plays a very small role in this film. He is basically the wrap-around narrator, which is all too much of him. The rest of the film has its funny parts, and most of the characters are actually likeable, even if they aren't completely believable. The plot doesn't come across as too contrived, and so the film turns out to be enjoyable. The ending, although not bad, feels quite tacked on, as if they ran out of budget.</p><p>Although enjoyable, I don't seen any reason why anyone should really go out and see this film. The women are attractive and the situations amusing, but there wasn't anything memorable about the film as a whole.</p>
80304|memyselfirene|DVD at aunt's house|2002-11-24|<p>This movie had caught my attention when it came out, but it had enough naysayers to convince me not to see it. As will always be the case, however, when I go back to Ohio to visit, I start watching movies I wouldn't normally watch. Since this one had caught my attention at one point and has the added bonus of Ren&#233;e Zellweger, it made for good late night fare.</p><p>Charlie is raising his three black sons, obviously the product of his ex-wife's infidelities on their wedding night with the chauffeur. Charlie works for the Rhode Island highway patrol (or something like that), and has the most yielding and non-confrontational attitude of anyone around. Then one day he snaps, and another personality, Hank, comes out. Hank doesn't take crap from anyone (although he isn't exactly effective at dealing it out, either). He then lands the job of escorting a woman to upstate New York, where she has be charged with something trumped up because she may know too much about her former boss's illegal activities.</p><p>The movie is funny at times, though far too many parts are just beyond reality that they don't fly. The absurdity doesn't come across as it needs to, so parts of the movie get quite trying. The real highlight is the female lead, who for me was the best part of the film.</p><p>No recommendation here. Fans of the actor or directors already know what to expect and what they want, everyone else can do without.</p>
80305|allaboutahlong|DVD at aunt's house|2002-11-26|<p>I don't have much to say in way of introduction to this film. I finally hit the public library looking for movies during my stay in Ohio. I'd been meaning to see this movie for a while, partly for name recognition (i.e., I recognized it) and partly because it sported Chow Yun Fat.</p><p>Ah Long is a working class joe who doesn't have much to offer his son, who he is raising alone. Then the opportunity comes along to put the kid into some film work, and this leads to someone from Ah Long's past coming back.</p><p>This is an interesting film, and Chow's role is well done and believable. The problem for me came with the situations that arise in the film, which are frustrating and annoying at times, after one has developed a sympathy for the situation as it is set-up. I almost want to say that there are characters in the movie who aren't realistic, but the sad fact is that they probably are. In the end, this movie may not make for enjoyable viewing, despite the good work that is put into it.</p><p>Not a happy film, this movie is worth watching if you like to see Chow in more dramatic roles, as many people say this is one of his best. I give a hesitant recommendation of the film, and probably would not openly recommend it to friends unless something specific told me they might want to see this kind of film.</p>
80306|spacecowboys|DVD at aunt's house|2002-11-26|<p>This movie looked rather silly to me when I first heard of it, but over time a review here or there seeped in and the movie got onto my radar screen. I had tucked it away as a movie I'd see at some point in the future, but hadn't really scheduled it for immediate viewing. In the end, though, it is still a Clint Eastwood film, which always promise to offer something.</p><p>The creation of NASA leaves the experimental pilots who had been hoping to be the first men into space high and dry. All but forgotten, they become quite useful when it is found out that a Russian satellite that is threatening to fall into the Earth's orbit has a guidance system stolen from one of our hero's designs. He is, therefore, the only one capable of fixing it. Riding the fine line between blackmail and necessity, the team is reassembled to make the trip to space to make the emergency repair... that is, if they can pass the physicals now.</p><p>This isn't a classic of the cinema, but I definitely enjoyed it. The humor is mixed together well with the drama and suspense, with some interesting politics thrown into the mix. There's some suspension of disbelief needed at times, but for the most part the film sticks to realistic scenarios and outcomes. We also have four actors who do a very good job and playing with the fact that they are getting quite old, and this comes across the best.</p><p>I recommend this film. If you are a fan of Clint or any of the other three actors which ground this film, you won't be disappointed.</p>
80307|mrdeeds|DVD at aunt's house|2002-11-26|<p>This is technically a remake of a 1930's <short=\"mrdeedsgoestotown\">movie</a> which I saw a while back. I actually watched the original after hearing about this movie, and thoroughly enjoyed that movie. But when this one hit the theaters, it started getting trashed. I know that Sandler's films tend to be hit or miss, so I refrained from seeing this in the theater and figured I may never see it until I saw it on the shelf in Ohio.</p><p>Longfellow Deeds inherits a considerable sum from a dead uncle who he has had no real contact with. The people at the head of Deeds' new company want to take control over it for themselves, and then to quickly downsize and cut up the company for the quick buck it will get them. They bring Deeds into New York city for the duration, assuming they can dupe him into signing the shares over to them for a nice sum. In the meantime, a journalist comes in to get the dirt of Deeds but ends up falling in love with him, and of course, vice versa.</p><p>A considerable number of elements from the original film that were believable in the 1930s just don't fly in the first decade of the 21st century. They are not, unfortunately, appropriately updated. Some of the elements of the first movie that make it a winner, such as Deeds' genuine concern for the welfare of others just don't come off when Sandler is at the helm. For example, there is  huge difference between giving the money away to needy farmers during the depression versus buying a Corvette for everyone in your hometown. In the end, Sandler adds nothing to the story but instead detracts considerably from it.</p><p>There's no reason for anyone to see this film. This is definitely another of Sandler's duds, of which he has his share. You only need see one bad Adam Sandler film to realize that you need to be careful with him.</p>
80308|banditqueen|DVD at aunt's house|2002-11-27|<p>I'd heard about the Bandit Queen before I knew there was a movie made of her. I think I heard about the movie after her death, and it was brought to my attention a few times since then. The real trick with this kind of movie is getting hold of it. I was pleasantly surprised that the <a href=\"http://fairfield.lib.oh.us\" title=\"Fairfield County Public Library\">Fairfield County Public Library</a> had a copy.</p><p>Phoolan Devi is married off before she has even reached puberty by her father who would rather have her dowry than her presence. The new husband, some 20 years her senior, isn't willing to wait to consummate the marriage either. Phoolan runs away back to her family but isn't welcome there either.  Eventually, she is taken by a band of bandits, where her treatment looks like it is going to be pretty much the same, when the bandit leader raping her is killed. Over time, she begins to make a name for herself as a bandit, despite the absence of women among that group of people. She also uses her power to fight against the treatment of women and the lowest castes (of which she is both).</p><p>The movie does bring up a number of the issues that affect Phoolan's life and make her a hero to many in India. Despite being based on real events, however, much of the film comes across as unrealistic, perhaps too dramatized. Although it does show some of the worst experiences in Phoolan's life, it  doesn't do a very good job of really showing why she became so popular. Many situations just happen without enough background or development. Despite the long length of the film as it is, I felt that it could have been done much better than it was.</p><p>The film is not horrible, but I think I wouldn't recommend it to many people. If someone has heard of Phoolan Devi, I would suggest finding some books written about her. I have not read any myself, but it seems a better option than a film which does a lackluster job of portraying her.</p>
80309|intheheatofthenight|DVD at aunt's house|2002-11-27|<p>I know that my parents used to watch the TV series based upon this film while I was growing up, but I never paid much attention to it and don't remember much of anything about it. My interest in Poitier was piqued by the last Academy Awards, as were certainly the interests of many others. Realizing that I hadn't seen any of his works, I figured it was time to remedy it with something I was fairly certain to be of quality.</p><p>Detective Virgil Tibbs is traveling through the South when he is taken in as a suspect in the murder of a local industrialist. A call to his police chief reveals to the local officials that this man is probably the best suited in the country to solve their crime, not the perpetrator. But the locals have to get over the racial problems of having a black man investigating a white man's murder over the heads of the white police force. They also have to deal with the fact that he doesn't mind stepping on the toes who everyone else has long since learned to avoid.</p><p>This is a classic for a reason. There is quality acting all around, and the story is an engrossing one. The racial tension plays out well and is believable. There's also something very gratifying about seeing Poitier slap a southern white aristocrat across the face after receiving the same blow himself.</p><p>The movie isn't incredibly complex, but it is still an excellent movie that is worth watching. I'd recommend it to anyone.</p>
80310|bunny|DVD at aunt's house|2002-11-27|<p>This is a short film that won an Academy Award and was put on the DVD with <short=\"iceage\">Ice Age</a>, as it was the same director. Although disappointed with the aforementioned movie, I was curious to see what they'd given an award to, and thus watched this short.</p><p>An aged bunny is going about her baking when a moth begins to bother her. After some effort, she seems to vanquish the moth, only to \"die\" upon entering the oven.</p><p>Not having learning my lesson from this guy's later work, I had it confirmed that he just is not a talent I have any interest in. This short is annoying at best, offensive at worst. Without the commentary track, I would not have been able to figure out most of the abstract symbolism. With the commentary track I knew that the symbolism was just a bunch of spiritualist garbage.</p><p>Don't see it. That's all I really need to say, you cannot get back those few precious moments of your life afterwards.</p>
80311|iceage|DVD at aunt's house|2002-11-27|<p>I didn't have much of a desire to see this in the theaters, since the reviews of friends and professionals seemed to be mixed, but I figured it was something I would catch when it came out on DVD. Sure enough, my aunt bought it when it hit the market, so I was bound to give it a watch.</p><p>A wooly mammoth, a giant sloth and a saber-tooth tiger come together to return a lost human child to its tribe. The saber-tooth tiger has ulterior motives, however, as his clan has ordered him to return with the human baby as a live sacrifice. For obvious reasons, the others don't trust him because of his predatory nature. While the other animals are all migrating south, these three set about their mission, as the human hunting group heads back to join its own tribe. Thrown into the movie is another imaginary squirrel-like creature who tries its darnedest to bury an acorn.</p><p>This movie is quite disturbing and definitely unsatisfying. Before we get to the plot problems, the film is just not that funny. The humor is spread too thin and just didn't do anything for me. The characters don't come across as likeable, either. And the squirrel-like creature just does absolutely nothing for the film. Yes, some of the animation is well-done, but that does not a movie make.</p><p>What was disturbing. Well, the saber-tooth tiger actually points it out once in the movie. They are going through a lot of heartache just to return a human child who will likely grow up and hunt them and their kind down. Fact is, the mammoth and the sloth were hunted to extinction by humans (the tiger died out for other reasons). So, in the end this film is a glorification of human beings over other species. I've got no problem with the human species, but portraying other animals with this irrational desire to help their predator is absurd (well, I guess it could be analogous to the way the workers of this society irrationally support the ruling classes, but that was not the goal the creators were going for here).</p><p>I most definitely recommend that no one see this film. It is crap. No one in any age group should be subjected to it.</p>
80312|deucebigalow|Video at aunt's house|2002-11-28|<p>I'd seen a good chunk of this film at some point, but didn't stick around to watch the whole thing then since I'd missed the beginning. It wasn't something I was dying to watch (I generally don't like Rob Schneider's comedy), but it was something I was looking out for.</p><p>Deuce is a pool cleaner with a passion for fish and little skill with the ladies. When a male gigolo's fish comes up sick just before the guy has to leave the country on a trip, Deuce is induced into taking care of the guy's place and the fish in the meantime. Unfortunately, Deuce smashes the very expensive fish tank and has to find some way to earn the money to replace it before the guy comes back. Deuce then takes up the gigolo trade himself, although he needs quite a bit of coaching and is paired up with women who are \"less-than-perfect\" by the standard definition.</p><p>This movie is actually quite good. The humor is mostly on target and on time. The thing I really love about this movie is the message it gets across about how to treat women and what is truly important in a human relationship. Even if you don't like Schneider, this is a worthwhile comedy.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to anyone. It isn't something to top your list, but it definitely a film worth watching at some point.</p>
80313|abettertomorrow|DVD at aunt's house|2002-11-28|<p>Another Chow Yun Fat movie that has been in my list of to-see movies for some time now.</p><p>Mark and Ho are friend working for the triads, couriers for their counterfeiting operation. Ho gets double-crossed and takes some time in prison, while Mark takes a bullet during a gun battle that leaves him crippled. Ho's younger brother, Kit, is trying to work his way up in the police department, but keeps coming up short because of his brother's reputation. Out of prison, Ho wants to start a new life, clean and free of crime, but there are pressures from all side and little support (especially not from an untrusting younger brother).</p><p>I don't have a lot to say about this film. It is good, as can be expected, with nice acting and excellent gun battles. The story doesn't pin things down to a simplistic good-guy versus bad-guy plot, and things come out without the tinge of the expected.</p><p>If you are a fan of Woo or Chow, this is a must-see (although Chow is not the lead actor, incidentally). Good Hong Kong action-drama from the mid-eighties.</p>
80314|charliesangels|DVD at sister's house|2002-11-29|<p>I cannot say I ever paid any attention to the original TV show, mostly because I was too young to care that much. I'd heard mixed things about this movie, but figured it was better than some of the other options at my sister's place.</p><p>When a powerful voice-recognition technology is stolen from programmer Eric Knox, Charlie is hired to track down the culprit using, of course, his three attractive agents. They are soon sent in to bug the competition, the most obvious suspect. But then their home based gets destroyed, and it becomes clear that their own organization is the target.</p><p>There is, admittedly, some fun stuff in this movie. A major problem, however, is that the stunt work is horrible. If you've ever seen a Hong Kong film, this movie is absolutely painful. I don't think they are going for consciously bad work here, they just get it because they don't bother putting in the money and time on things that would make it work. Instead, they blew the budget on other special effects that just don't pass.</p><p>There's nothing about this movie to recommend. I wasn't completely disappointed, but I surely wouldn't watch it again. Three attractive women who kick butt does not necessarily mean the movie will be worth watching.</p>
80315|wonderseven|DVD at home|2002-11-30|<p>I wasn't sure if I'd seen this film before or not (which gets back to why I started these movie reviews in the first place), mixing up the titles and plots of a handful of HK action films that feature Ms. Yeoh.</p><p>A group of seven secret agents from mainland China attempt to unravel an international criminal organization in Hong Kong. As they investigate, their own get injured while others of them come under suspicion. One of them is developing some kind of relationship with a henchman from the other organization, but claims that there is something about her that can be trusted. Can the others still trust him, and will they stick together when their own commanders start to push them in the wrong direction.</p><p>I had seen this one before, but got confused because I though the seven of the title were all female (which is another film that I cannot remember right now). The action and comedy are mixed here, but overall the movie is rather lackluster. It isn't just that there are too many characters, but that they just are acceptable. What I mean is that their absurdities just didn't lend themselves to the proper level of suspension of disbelief.</p><p>The movie isn't horrible, but there is little reason I can give to others to actually go out and see it. If you are looking for mindless Hong Kong action, it will do in a pinch, but there are certainly better movies out there.</p>
80316|pulpfiction|Video at home|2002-12-01|<p>I'd been meaning to go back and watch this film for a while, but just hadn't gotten around to it. I've even been tempted to buy the DVD, but didn't feel it was worth it when I have a decent video already.</p><p>The plot on this movie is hard to pin down, as it twists and intermingles. There are two young robbers who decide to knock over a restaurant and start the film off. Then we have two gangsters who have been sent to recover a package for their boss. One of those gangsters is set to spend an evening with the boss's wife, which goes a bit haywire when she O.D.s. There's also the boxer, who decides that he's going to take the money and run instead of taking the fall from the same boss mentioned above. Overall, it is a mix of time frames and plots that only come together near the end.</p><p>I don't think it takes any convincing for anyone to see this film. It is considered by many already to be a classic of American cinema, and is listed in several places as one of the greatest films ever. I don't worship the film nearly so highly, but I definitely love it and will certainly watch it again in the future. If only there weren't so many annoying imitations!</p>
80317|snatch|DVD at home|2002-12-01|<p>I've already reviewed this <short=\"snatch\">movie</a>. The main change I have to make to that earlier review is that I went ahead an bought it, since I kept thinking of scenes from the movie afterward and the opportunity arose to get it at a discount. The movie is worth it, with lines and scenes that will likely go down in my personal history of the movies, if not in any official one.</p>
80318|traffik|Video at home|2002-12-02|<p>I saw the American <short=\"traffic\">remake</a> of this movie when it was in the theaters, but had yet to get around to seeing the original. A friend of mine lent me the video he'd taped off of PBS.</p><p>The movie is an intertwining of several different plots that emphasize the nature of the drug trade (in this case heroin) for the U.K. One character is a Member of Parliament who is heading a commission to stymie the drug trade, particularly in Pakistan where the government is about to give aid to help their anti-drug efforts. The daughter of this M.P. is addicted to Heroin, however, and his discovery of this tests his understanding of the problem. In Pakistan, a poor farmer's opium crop is destroyed and he must turn to the city and helping a powerful drug lord in order to support his family. But, this is only as long as he is loyal and useful. And then there is the British wife of a German drug trafficker who has to figure out how to maintain her lifestyle when her husband comes under indictment.</p><p>Except for the details, the Soderbergh remake was fairly loyal to this original. As a result, most aspect of this film are simply more detailed, and if you liked the remake you should enjoy this film even more. There was only one area that I thought Soderbergh did better, and that was the wife of the drug trafficker. In the more recent adaptation, I felt the director did a better job of making the character sympathetic and exploring her motives more clearly.</p><p>You have to be committed to watch this movie, given how long it is. If you've already seen the American version, you will want to watch this version if you are truly interested in the subject matter and messages. If you are just looking for an original film, you've already seen a faithful summary. If you haven't seen either, I really recommend seeing both, especially if you know little about the drug problem in the world today.</p>
80319|allabouteve|DVD at home|2002-12-02|<p>I knew nothing about this movie when I rented it, just that it was an old film that had won some awards and had some talented actresses in it. I don't know anyone whose opinion I trust to tell me about good old movies, so I just sample a new one every now and then.</p><p>We start with the present, as Eve is receiving the highest award for theatrical performance in the U.S. But then we flashback, and see that just a year ago, Eve was just a fan of Margo Channing. Margo is the biggest draw in the theaters of New York. A friend of Margo's introduces Eve to her, and their relationship soon develops. Eve tries to be perfect, to help Margo in every way, in many cases invading into Margo's personal life a little too much. It soon becomes clear that Eve has some personal ambitions that she hadn't been so up-front about.</p><p>The only problem with this film was that it suddenly became much harder to watch other movies. This is one of the best scripts I've ever had the pleasure of watching unfold on screen. The conversations between the characters is extremely intelligent and witty, and to boot the women are strong characters who take action in their own lives. After watching this, I realized just how bad contemporary cinema has gotten, just how pathetic the writing is in the movies that are put out today.</p><p>It is hard to describe this film and even touch upon the beauty that it is. I recommend this movie to everyone. It is a refreshing viewing that holds up after a half-century without any need for assistance... one of the greatest movies of all time.</p>
80320|rashomon|DVD at home|2002-12-03|<p>I've seen this film probably more than most films, certainly more times than I've seen any other drama I can think of. I've seen it probably 2 or 3 times for a class, and at least once on the big screen. These viewings weren't burdens by any stretch of the imagination, and when I saw the film was released by <a href=\"http://www.criterionco.com\" title=\"Criterion Collection\">Criterion</a>, there was little doubt that it would join my collection.</p><p>As three men gather around the southern gate to Kyoto, one thing is certain, a man is dead. The gathered men begin to retell the story of what happened, through the various eyes available. There's Tajomaru, the rogue who the man and his wife as they were passing through the forest and is now on trial for murder and possibly rape. There's the wife. There's the murdered man as seen through the eyes of a shaman. Then to round things out, we have two different accounts from the woodsman who stands beneath the gate of the Rashomon and tells the newcomer his version of things. And, everyone has a reason to tell their own story.</p><p>Anyone who serious likes the cinema must see this film. Kurosawa broke ground with this movie, and its effect on everything (i.e., not just cinema) has been profound. This is truly a masterpiece, with excellent acting all around and some amazing cinematography that just revels in the black and white.</p><p>Everyone should see this film. That's really all there is to say.</p>
80321|liliesofthefield|DVD at home|2002-12-03|<p>As part of my project to see more of Poitier's movies, I got this one. The premise of the movie didn't grab me, but since it won an Oscar I figured it would be worth a try.</p><p>Homer Smith's car breaks down near a convent somewhere in the Southwest. The German-speaking nuns coax Smith into doing some repair work for them, but leave the issue of payment as vague. After several days of back-and-forth, Smith is soon lured into building the nuns a chapel. The problem is, the nuns don't seem to have the money for it, and Smith still has to get by himself.</p><p>I guess charming would be a good word to describe this film, but then I should add that I generally don't like charming films. It is certainly a film that would be more appealing to a christian, which I most certainly am not. The acting and set-up are all competent, but the premise is just not one that pulled any sympathy from me. It was something of a chore to get to the end of this one.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, although I can acknowledge it might have some value to a certain kind of person. It's not the kind of feel-good movie I go in for.</p>
80322|myschoolmate|VCD at home|2002-12-03|<p>I bought this VCD some time back, looking to fill out an order that gave me a good discount if I bought one more disc. I'd read decent reviews of this film, and know that the actors aren't half bad, so figured the few dollars I shelled out wouldn't be too wasted no matter what.</p><p>Stone was the top fighter at TBS high school until he left a year ago. At this high school (for delinquents), the triads are kept out but problems are solved through a simple fighting system in an upstairs room after school. When Edward, an excellent student, is accidentally transferred into the school, he finds a friend in Stone, who is willing to teach him a little about fighting in order to save his behind, although he has given up fighting, himself. But Mantis, who is currently the top fighter, wants to test his skills against Stone. That opportunity arises when Edward is kidnapped.</p><p>The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and neither should the viewer. It is fairly fun, and the fight scenes have some interesting innovation that was nice to see. Overall, the movie is nothing to shout about. The characters aren't all that involving, but you still find yourself interested.</p><p>I cannot say I'd recommend this film to many people. It doesn't break any new ground, so it just ends up being a decent HK action flick.</p>
80323|serpico|DVD at home|2002-12-06|<p>I'd heard references to this film probably since college, if not earlier. The problem was that there was never any motivation for me to see it, since I never had anyone telling me I \"had\" to see it.</p><p>Based on a true story, the movie follows the life of Frank Serpico, a rookie cop in New York City. His problem. He's honest and doesn't want to engage in the corruption that's all around him in the police force. Because he isn't quiet about it, because he doesn't go along, it also means that he cannot make it to detective like he wants to. He tried to change things from within, but it is obvious that the weight of the whole department is against him. And then outside of the department all the powerful city officials seem to be in on it as well.</p><p>I didn't like this film, and it all boils down to the impression that Serpico is a whiny bastard. This isn't to say that police corruption isn't an issue or that he wasn't right about a lot of the things he had to say. It was just that I really couldn't agree with the way this guy lived his life. In spite of the reality before him, he remains naive and ends up paying for it. Maybe this wasn't the reality of things, but after seeing this movie, I'm not motivated to find out anything more about this guy who in the end fled to Europe because he couldn't handle the realities of the U.S. It guess I just don't like to see people fighting good causes ineptly.</p><p>I don't recommend this film. There are plenty of films which do a good job, even when filtered through the eyes of a fictional story, of showing the nature of police and political corruption in this country. We're supposed to get behind this character, and I just couldn't, despite how horrible his opponents were.</p>
80324|inthebedroom|DVD at home|2002-12-08|<p>Frank Fowler has gotten involved with an older woman who has children and a belligerent ex-husband. While his parents what him to pursue his college dreams of learning to be an architect, he gets more involved with the woman. When he gets murdered, his parent's own relationship comes into question, as the two have drifted apart over the years and don't see eye to eye on how to deal with their loss.</p><p>I got a bit built up about this movie, expecting a lot from it. That isn't always a good mind frame in which to watch something. I also wasn't sure what to expect, since the trailers had even avoided definitively saying that the son was killed. I was expecting a lot of dialogue and interplay. This is there, but it didn't manage to grab me as I'd hoped. I was, however, very much surprised by the end of the movie, which just turned the movie into something else.</p><p>This film has some great acting, but by the end I wasn't convinced of the believability of some pivotal characters. For this reason, I cannot say I'd really recommend it to other people. I didn't hate the movie, and I can see where other people might like it, but it certainly won't be a movie I think of fondly in the future.</p>
80325|fellowship|DVD at home|2002-12-15|<p>I've seen <short=\"fellowship\">this</a> before, as must be expected, but I also had to buy the extended version of the DVD when it came out. I'd thought about waiting for all the movies to come out, but then figured it wasn't worth the bother.</p><p>I don't have much to add over my previous review. I wasn't keeping track as I watched of what was in the theatrical release and what was new. The one really obvious thing was the Galadriel's gift giving, which was cut from the theater and left an odd gap in there that puts a minor bump in continuity. All in all, it is a great film, and I'll certainly be watching it again in the years to come. This time, I wanted to watch it in preparation for the next one.</p>
80326|twotowers|Edwards Cinemas at Irvine Spectrum|2002-12-21|<p>As Frodo and Samwise make their way into Mordor, they know that Gollum is following them. Capturing him, Frodo forces him to lead their way, since he's been there before. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli track Merry and Pippin, only to run into Gandalf. While Merry and Pippin work with the Ents, trying to convince them to make a stand against the growing power of Mordor, the other four head to Th?oden. Th?oden, revived by Gandalf, decides to take his people to Helmsdeep to stand against the coming Orc invasion.</p><p>I went in very curious how there were going to handle certain elements of the film. What we get in this movie is a slightly shortened version of the middle book, with a few things saved for next year. There's quite a bit more changes to the text in this movie, after the first movie had been much more loyal. Helmsdeep, in particular, is built up much more and made more of a centerpiece. The Ents, unfortunately, are given very little screen time, and their role in everything feels like a footnote by the time we get to that section of the film (despite this being one of my favorite parts of the book). Some things were handled quite well, though, and the overall movie was still quite enjoyable.</p><p>The real gem of this movie is Sm?agol. The acting is amazing. I was pleased to have this split personality aspect of the character done so well, especially since I had not really grasped it when I read the books. The CGI is also very impressive here. His body is done in such as way that you can see he was once a hobbit, and that that shell is still there, although everything else has been removed. I couldn't shake the feeling though, that he looked like Steve Buscemi.</p><p>If you aren't already a fan, you need to see the first movie. But once you've enjoyed that film, this is the next logical step. It isn't as great as the first one, but it comes close enough to make me happy.</p>
80327|ipcressfile|DVD at home|2002-12-22|<p>Counter espionage agent Harry Palmer is switched to another department which is on its last leg. Everyone's trying to find out what happened to a kidnapped scientist, with the intent of buying him back. Harry tracks down the man directly responsible, and the government soon buys back their scientist, but he turns out to be damaged goods. As clues begin seeping in, Harry isn't sure who in the department he can trust.</p><p>I'd been drawn to this film because I knew it was an influence for the Austin Powers character, and that Caine was used in the latest <short=\"goldmember\">movie</a>. I also figured it would be a good spy movie. One of the most fascinating things about the movie was the slow pace. I didn't mind this, but it is something that you just don't see in films of this nature today. Another odd thing was that the film actually showed the boring aspect of espionage work, the work behind a desk and the paperwork. It is nice that Palmer is very much a nerd, and thus an appealing hero to watch on screen. </p><p>This isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but if you can handle the old-school pacing and like thrillers, the movie is worth a watch.</p>
80328|mylefteyeseesghosts|DVD at home|2002-12-22|<p>May loses her husband only seven days after meeting him on vacation in the Caribbean. As her husband was quite wealthy, she inherits a great deal back in Hong Kong. But there's her mother-in-law, sister-in-law and her husbands ex-girlfriend to contend with, and they all work at the same company, which she is forced to at least come in to occasionally. Distraught over the loss of her husband, she is in a drunk driving accident and as a result gains the ability to see ghosts with her left eye. And the main ghost she sees is a boy from grade school who was thought to have died during one of his class-clown antics.</p><p>This is not a horror film in the least, as some people have labeled it. It is a romantic comedy about a woman learning to cope with the death of a loved one and maybe even someday become able to move on with her life. The mix of unbelievable elements meshes in well with the story, and the ending is actually surprising (at least to me it was) and unexpected. Sammi and Lau are both great actors. The only part of the film that got on my nerves was the ex-girlfriend. Her role fits into the film, but I think it could have been done differently.</p><p>This is a pretty good film and worth watching, especially if you are into the genre.</p>
80329|donniedarko|DVD at friend's house|2002-12-24|<p>I've already seen <short=\"donniedarko\"view=2002-05-12 title=\"Donnie Darko film review\">this film</a>, but when we got back to my friend's place his brother had rented it. I really liked the film, so I figured it was worth sticking around to watch again. My opinion has only improved with a second viewing, as this film is just chocked full of commentary on the problems of this society and growing up in it.</p>
80330|dieanotherday|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2002-12-24|<p>Bond gets taken prisoner during an assassination attempt in North Korea. When he is released, he is kept under guard with the suspicion that he was the one responsible for spilling information about some U.S. agents. The conflict diamonds that Bond has as his sole clue to the North Korean's outside agent lead him to Cuba, where he meets up with NSA agent Jinx. He then turns to Gustav Graves, and Icelandic nouveau-riche whose diamonds are identical in composition to conflict diamonds.</p><p>Well, a Bond film is a Bond film. This one has most of what you'd expect. I wasn't sure how the dialogue was meant to be taken, however. Gustav Graves only spews out sound bites, pseudo-pithy phrases. Bond and Jinx's conversation seems to be just about the same, an exchange of one-liners without much more. I'm cautious of this in particular because Halle Berry has managed to land some of the worst lines in movie-scripting history (<short=\"xmen\">X-Men</a>). She didn't really do anything for me in this movie, either. The style works for the bad guy, though, seeming quite appropriate by the end of the film.</p><p>This isn't one of the best Bond films, but it still meets the standard and is worth watching if you enjoy the franchise.</p>
80331|z|Video at home|2002-12-25|<p>In Greece, 1963, a peaceful anti-nuclear weapon demonstration is pushed from venue to smaller venue but still allowed to go on. Numerous right-wing counter demonstrators show up ready for violence, and only a handful of police are on the scene to pretend they are keeping order. And then a government minister is murdered. The military and government want to just dismiss it, cover it up, but a maverick investigator helped by a journalist start to uncover something more sinister than drunk driving. When the investigation begins to touch the upper echelons of power, there is only one option left for them.</p><p>This is one of the greatest political films ever made. I've seen it a few times already and bought the video some time ago. This movie is an account of what happens to liberal policies during hard times. Plain and simple, they don't work. If anything, the weakness of the film is that is doesn't emphasize the alternative enough, since there is really only one character who seems to be leaning in the right direction. But for political development and analysis of a situation as it develops, there are few complaints that I can register.</p><p>Everyone should see this film, especially politically naive or ignorant people. Remember, though, that this film may take place in Greece, but can still take place anywhere.</p>
80332|goldmember|DVD at home|2002-12-28|<p>When Austin's father doesn't show up for his knighting, it is just yet another in a long list of absences. But then Austin's father is kidnapped by Goldmember, a Dutch criminal from the seventies. Traveling back in time, Austin teams of with Foxxy in order to find and recover his dad. Of course, Goldmember is working for Dr. Evil, who has revived Goldmember's plan to pull a meteor into the planet Earth if his demands are not met.</p><p>It probably helped that I didn't have high expectations for this film. The series is bound to wear thin, but this movie actually keeps things lively and interesting. The humor level is kept fairly high, and you will never hear me complain about watching Ms. Knowles on screen.</p><p>If you liked the first two installments of this series, I think you'll like this one as well. I just hope they don't try to make another one.</p>
80333|ourlady|DVD at home|2002-12-28|<p>Fernando, a cynical author who has come back to his hometown of Medellin, Columbia to retire, enters into a relationship with a teenage boy, Alexis. Alexis, like many youths in the city, is involved in the gang warfare of the drug trade. He has several people out to kill him, and he is not afraid to use a gun for the pettiest of reasons. Fernando, at first disturbed by this, soon finds that it fits in with his own cynical outlook on the world. When Alexis is shot down, Fernando unknowingly hooks up with his murderer, Wilmar, another youth of the same culture of violence.</p><p>I was not impressed with the trailer to this film when I saw it, but a friend of mine recommended it. I think he liked how the film showed the violence of the city of Medellin, which really isn't depicted too far from the truth in this film, unfortunately. This, however, is the only positive aspect of the entire movie. Fernando is an absolutely despicable character, and there is nothing at all interesting about his pedophilia. In the end, if there is a message that the director was trying to get across, it was not clear. And, with a movie with such unlikable characters and situations, the viewer has to be able to get something out of it.</p><p>Nobody should have to sit through this film, and many times during the watching of it I was on the edge of shutting it off. Masochism and the hope that something better might turn up at the end kept me hanging on. I just got hung, though. I can never recover the two hours of my life that were wasted on it.</p>
80334|gingkobed|DVD at home|2003-01-02|<p>Su-hyun is a artist who doesn't seem to be going anywhere in life, despite the encouragement (or is it nagging) of his doctor girlfriend. Then he gets a gingko bed, made from the tree that held the spirit of Midan. A long time ago, Midan and Su-hyun has been lovers. But General Hwang took Midan for his own, though he could never win her heart. After their deaths, they come to inhabit two gingko tree which grow side-by-side in a meadow until the General strikes Su-hyun with lightning. Now, in the modern world, the General is determined to win Midan once and for all, but the ancient lovers don't want this. In the meantime, the girlfriend gets fired at work because Midan uses a body from the hospital to materialize before her lover.</p><p>The first thing I have to say is that South Korean film has come a long way since the mid-nineties. The basic story here, a romance, has a lot of potential. The problem is that there are a number of things that get in the way. First, the special effects end up detracting from the movie because most of them are very poorly done. Second, there are gaps in the plot and flow of the movie that could easily have been filled in. For example, the protagonist's new found love for the ghostly Midan just isn't convincing because it is glossed over. Off screen, apparently, he remembered in his soul that they were bound, but we don't see enough on screen to justify his reactions and actions. The girlfriend's story is also just off the wall.</p><p>I liked the film, but I really cannot recommend it to other people. If re-made with an improved script and budget, it could be a very good fantasy romance, but as it stands it ends up coming across as silly.</p>
80335|rushmore|DVD at home|2003-01-08|<p>Max Fischer attends Rushmore Academy on scholarship. He's one of the worst students in the school, but he also is involved in more clubs than anyone. Amidst the threat of expulsion for his poor performance, he falls for a first grade teacher, Ms. Cross. He then puts his bizarre organizing skills to work in order to impress her. His attempts to get an aquarium built are the last straw for the administration, and he is force to enter a public high school. Meanwhile, he has befriended the father of two students at Rushmore, an industrialist. But then he falls for Ms. Cross as well, and the competition between the two turns quite vicious. Max isn't exactly adjusting well to his new school, either.</p><p>This film is just odd. Max's charm is that he is such an inconceivable character, to the extent that he is believable. This movie isn't non-stop laughs, but keeps at it with its own brand of quirky humor, which I cannot even begin to explain. In the end, our fifteen-year-old has grown a little, but not too much. Oh, and it also doesn't hurt that the two most important women in the film are highly attractive.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to others, although it does require an appreciation for somewhat intellectual humor. This is not a comedy for the base humor crowd.</p>
80336|swordsman|DVD at home|2003-01-12|<p>A sacred scroll of martial art knowledge is stolen from the imperial library, and a powerful eunuch is looking to recover it. His assistant clearly has hopes of finding it first, as well. As forces converge on the suspected thief, a student of Wah mountain arrives on the scene and learns (unbeknownst to him) the location of the scroll as the thief dies. Pretty soon, a few more groups are in on the power struggle, including the student's own master.</p><p>I wanted to see this for a while, since I've seen the second one several times (though not recently). This was is pretty good as well, though at times it is hard to follow the interconnection of things. This is partly due to subtitles which don't stay on screen long enough, but the large number of active parties involved is also partly to blame. In any case, the fighting is fun to watch, though I wouldn't place it at the level of classic.</p><p>If you've seen the Jet Li sequel and liked it, you will probably like this one. A solid wuxia film, it certainly isn't for everyone.</p>
80337|liloandstitch|DVD at home|2003-01-13|<p>Stitch is an illegal biological experiment, designed to be the ultimate war machine. The galactic authorities decide to imprison him and his creator, but Stitch has other plans, escaping to Earth - one of the Hawaiian islands to be exact. With two other aliens hot on his trail, he 'disguises' himself as a dog and is adopted into Lilo's family. Lilo's family consists of her and her older sister, their parents having died in an accident. Then there is the child welfare fellow who is threatening to take Lilo away if the older sister doesn't prove herself fit to raise her - and soon.</p><p>There are many times in this movie where I was surprised that Disney was behind it. The first obvious one is when Lilo punches another girl square in the face, and then proceeds to bite her. Stitch, obviously, isn't a model of morality either. Somehow, the studio which produces some of the worst indoctrination material for kids the world over managed to produce a film that is worth watching and didn't turn my stomach. In fact, I really enjoyed the film. The extras on the disc were also good, especially the trailers which I hadn't seen in the theater.</p><p>This is one of the finest Disney movies in history, and definitely the best thing that studio has put out in many, many years. It is worth watching and a lot of fun, for adults as well as kids.</p>
80338|caddyshack|DVD at work|2003-01-15|<p>Danny, a caddy at an exclusive country club, needs to land a scholarship in order to afford to go to college. When the caddy scholarship opens up, he hopes to land the scholarship, if only he can keep out of trouble. In addition to this, there are a number of various sub-plots and just skit-style bits that get mashed together into one movie. It comes across as a coherent whole, somehow, but the plot seems mostly incidental.</p><p>I think part of why films like this don't get made anymore is because it would cost too much to get the talent together. Then there is the issue of improv, which seems more prevalent in these older comedies. But then again, maybe it's just that I've grown out of these comedies. I still like this one, but perhaps that's nostalgia. A similar set-up these days would probably not get me into the theater.</p><p>That said, this is something of a classic. I hadn't seen it since probably junior high. I didn't pick up any deeper meaning this time around, but could enjoy much of the humor, especially Dangerfield. It's a fun movie, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone significantly younger than myself.</p>
80339|nationalsecurity|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2003-01-18|<p>Hank and his partner are beat cops who come across a warehouse break-in, and Hank's partner is shot. Earl Montgomery gets kicks out of the police academy for being a little too nuts. When the two meet, Hank is soon out of a job and heading to prison. Back out in the world, Hank has to take a job as a security guard, but spends his nights trying to track down who killed his partner, since the LAPD doesn't seem to be doing anything about it. Earl is a rent-a-cop for the same company, when their paths cross again when the same people rob another warehouse.</p><p>I didn't go into this movie expecting anything complicated or thought provoking. What I got was an enjoyable action comedy with much more action that I expected. The movie mixes together the consciously absurd with the realistic in a pleasant blend that kept me laughing. It was particularly nice to see it able to make fun of itself a bit.</p><p>If you like Martin Lawrence's comedy, then you are definitely going to like this film. For other people, you should be aware of what you are getting in to (because a lot of critics didn't like the movie), but I'm happy I saw it.</p>
80340|julietofthespirits|DVD at home|2003-01-19|<p>The forty-something Juliet suspects her husband of having an affair, but her life is so settled and solid that she resists it. She dabbles with the spirit world, including talking to mystics. She daydreams or hallucinates about different images. She has a neighbor who invites her into debauchery. All the signs tell her to ditch her husband before he ditches her, but will she pay attention to them.</p><p>I'd never seen a Fellini film, so I figured it was about time. Now that I know what to expect, I don't need to ever see one again. My problem with the film was that it was too artistic. I've surely mentioned it before, but when I cannot figure out the various symbols that the director is throwing my way, then the movie is too obscure. Mind you, it was filmed beautifully, and the lead actress was amazing to watch, but that's where my praise of the film ends.</p><p>I don't recommend this film to anyone. Pretentious art film fans will probably enjoy it, but everyone else will wonder why they bothered in the first place.</p>
80341|12angrymen|DVD at home|2003-01-20|<p>The life of an eighteen-year-old boy is on the line when the jury retires to the jury room to begin deliberation. The case seems open and shut, and all but one of the jurors vote guilty from the start. One juror, however, feels that the decision is much too critical for it to pass without discussion. As they begin to explore the case, the case for a reasonable doubt begins to build.</p><p>In one sense, yes, the movie is quite predictable, but that is what makes it a gem, when you know what is coming and you still enjoy the ride. Some of the issues that are brought up seem a bit simplistic, but it helps highlight the point that the poor almost never get adequate representation on legal matters. The film also does an excellent job of pulling out a variety of personalities who all are motivated to vote one way or the other for their own reasons. Although the movie doesn't question the death penalty (its major fault, on the political level), it does bring up a lot of other interesting questions.</p><p>This classic movie is definitely worth watching. It is always refreshing to watch a good movie that doesn't have to bother with special effects or elaborate settings, but uses dialogue to keep your attention.</p>
80342|kanzosensei|DVD at home|2003-01-25|<p>In early 1945, Dr. Akagi is facing an epidemic of hepatitis. It seems everyone has it, and the good doctor makes it his mission to find its cause and eradicate it, for the future of Japan. Meanwhile, he takes on as an assistant a young woman whose relatives want her to give up prostitution and take on a real job, despite the lower pay of such jobs.</p><p>The movie is kind of hard to explain, but I liked it. It is mostly quirky, like some of Imamura's other recent films. There is social commentary in there as well, and plenty of humor. Basically, if you've liked Imamura's latest stuff, you'll like this one.</p>
80343|thepianist|Loews Cineplex Beverly Center Cineplex|2003-01-26|<p>Wladyslaw Szpilman is a Jew living in Warsaw when the NAZIs invade Poland. He is also a pianist, that being his only real skill, and is known as one of the best in the country. As the NAZIs pull the noose tighter around the neck of the Jewish community, we see how it affects Wladyslaw and his family. He manages to avoid being sent to Treblinka, and survives in the ghetto until shortly before the uprising. He manages to contact some people who are willing to hide him, though even that has unexpected perils.</p><p>This movie is quite good, as can be expected from Polanski. The thing which is most fascinating is that the main character isn't really interesting. He doesn't have any particularly noble or redeming qualities, though he isn't detestable either. What makes the movie is all the things that are going on around and to him while he is simply trying to survive. That is what is telling about the movie.</p><p>This movie is definitely recommended, a worthwhile watch for anyone.</p>
80344|shanghaiknights|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2003-02-09|<p>Chon Wang is working as the local sheriff in Carson City, Nevada when he gets word that his father has been killed and his sister has tracked the murderer to London. He immediately heads to New York City to track down his old friend, Roy O'Bannon, who has invested his share of the gold. Roy, of course, doesn't have any more of it, but is willing to join Chon on his trip to London, when Chon hopes to get revenge.</p><p>The chemistry between these two in the first film was great, and it doesn't disappear here. The comedy, a mix of anachronisms and physical humor, is at least at the same level, if not higher. It's also quite nice to see Jackie get his chance to play at several different roles I'm sure he's been dreaming of for years, such as the Keystone Kops. It also doesn't hurt that Fann Wong is a pleasure to watch on screen for many reasons. With all of the bad fight choreography in American movies, it's such a pleasure to see creative and well-performed work.</p><p>This is a must-see for anyone who liked the first film. There's no doubt that I'll be adding it to my DVD collection when the time comes.</p>
80345|stolenmoments|Magic Johnson Theaters at Crenshaw Plaza|2003-02-09|<p>This is a documentary about the effects of capitalism on hip hop, culture and music. Interviews with artists and different people in the industry are intermixed with clips from movies and music videos. The overall message is that yet another cultural entity has been taken over and controlled by corporations, often with the participants unaware of what is really going on.</p><p>I has actually came to see a different film which was canceled, but this one was interesting. While staying specific to hip hop, it was clear to me that the problems were universal. With black music, as well as all art in all truth, there is a constant history of common people creating music or art that is then coopted by industries to sell product to a wider audience while toning down the messages in a way that creates complicity. This movies doesn't address this phenomenon as a whole, just for hip hop, but it still does it fairly well. Particularly nice is the honesty of music industry executives, who see what they are doing. It's all to easy to see things as a conspiracy when one doesn't see the human element behind these things.</p><p>This half-hour documentary is worth catching, even if you know little to  nothing about hip hop (which is pretty much the boat I'm in).</p>
80346|faatkine|Magic Johnson Theaters at Crenshaw Plaza|2003-02-10|<p>Faat Kine is a manager of a gas station, living fairly well as a single mother of two children. The two kids are about to finish high school with hopes of going on to college. When they make it, both fathers try to come back into their lives despite their long absence. But the kids aren't quite sympathetic to their mother, either, holding her past against her at times.</p><p>There is a lot of good interplay here that deals with the position of women in Senegalese society, the nature of national independence, and the tensions between the christians and the muslims. The movie is a bit hard to take at first, the acting feeling a little off, at least in the delivery of lines. Physically, Venus does a great job, but conversation takes a while before it feels natural. Perhaps part of this is due to the translation. Nevertheless, the story is a sympathetic one that has excellent messages and ideas throughout.</p><p>This film will probably be hard to get hold of, but it is worth checking out if you can, especially if you are not familiar with Senegalese society. Sembene is an excellent writer that everyone should be exposed to in some manner; I recommend <strong>God's Bits of Wood</strong> in particular.</p>
80347|badlands|DVD at home|2003-02-14|<p>Holly is moved north from Texas when her widower father wants a change of life. The fifteen-year-old girl soon thereafter meets Kit, a man about ten years older than her. They hit it off, and begin to spend a lot of time together until her father finds out. Enduring the separation for a while, Kit finally forces the issue, ending it with Holly's father dead from a gunshot wound. Setting fire to the place, they set off into the Dakota badlands to fend for themselves and avoid the police as long as possible.</p><p>The most amazing thing about this movie to me was that Sissy Spacek was actually about ten years older than the character she played, and she didn't look a day over fifteen. The story itself isn't that amazing. The choices the two make are interesting and revealing. The way that Kit is treated at the end of the movie is quite surreal.</p><p>I cannot say I'd recommend this to anyone, mostly because it just didn't move me at all. It wasn't horrible, but just sort of there.</p>
80348|somelikeithot|DVD at home|2003-02-15|<p>Joe and Jerry are having trouble makings ends meet in 1929 Chicago. It looks like they are about to get paid for their work as musicians in a speak-easy, but then the cops raid and they are lucky just to get away. After witnessing a gangland murder, they are on the run and dress up as women to become part of a gig heading to Florida. Another member of the women's ensemble, however, is Sugar, and it is just a bit too difficult to stay in  their roles as women with her around.</p><p>For a straight comedy, this one still holds up quite well after all these years. I'd wanted to see the movie partly because I'd never really seen Marilyn in anything. She ended up being the most disappointing part of the movie, and even she wasn't bad (is she really that much of an airhead?).</p><p>This isn't gut-busting laughter anymore, but it is still worth watching. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes older comedies.</p>
80349|daredevil|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2003-02-16|<p>Matt Murdock is blinded as a youth, but the chemicals that take his sight make his other senses that much stronger. With his father murdered because he refused to throw a fight, Matt wants to be able to take revenge. Fast forward to Matt as an adult, working as a successful lawyer in Hell's Kitchen. At night, he dressed up in a leather costume and brings justice to those who manage to avoid it in the courtroom. Elektra walks into his life, and he suddenly has something else to live for. But her father is involved in criminal activity himself, and when he tries to get out of it, the Kingpin won't sit idly by.</p><p>I had to see this film, since Daredevil has been one of my favorite characters since I was younger. And, overall, I have to say that the movie was entertaining. The best part for me was all the comic book references. There are cameos by Stan Lee, Kevin Smith and Frank Miller, just to name a few. Many of the unimportant names are also comic people, such a Jose Quesada and John Romita. To the film makers' credit, they also do a very good job of covering over Affleck and Garner's complete lack of physical ability.</p><p>There are quite a few negative things that can be said about this film. The CGI is gratuitous at times, and not natural at other times. There are several comic-book aspects that are a bit overdone and unnecessary, pushing the viewer's suspension of disbelief a little farther than needed. The movie also tries to cram in a lot a bit too quickly, and the pacing just seemed a bit overwhelming. And then there are the complaints I have as a fan of the comic, but I'll refrain from going into most of those. The one I just cannot let go, though, is that Garner doesn't look a bit Greek.</p><p>I cannot honestly recommend this film to anyone. It was fun, and I'm sure kids will enjoy it. There's many a bone thrown to comic book fans. But for your average viewer, I just don't think its worth the time.</p>
80350|bullitt|DVD at home|2003-02-22|<p>Frank Bullitt is a cop in San Francisco, assigned to protect the life of a man set to testify on Monday. When the man is gunned down on Saturday, Bullitt is determined to figure out who is behind it. Along the way, he must fight against the politician who charged him with protecting the man in the first place.</p><p>The most famous thing this movie is known for is the car chase through the streets of San Francisco. I can understand why, and I could tell that this movie would have been a lot of fun to see in the theaters. Basically, every car chase in San Francisco is getting it from this movie. The story itself is interesting as well, one of the slower-paced detective movies that you just don't see much of these days.</p><p>I'd recommend this film if it sounds interesting to you. It has been labeled the greatest car film ever, but even if that doesn't grab you, it's an interesting story.</p>
80351|aresenicandoldlace|DVD at home|2003-02-23|<p>Mortimer Brewster, a drama critic in New York City famous for his stance against marriage, is getting married. But, as they prepare to leave for the honeymoon, Mortimer finds out that his aunts have been poisoning old men and burying them in the basement. He doesn't want his aunts to be punished, but also doesn't want them to continue with their odd behavior, and so he quickly becomes sidetracked from the marriage and puts to work having his uncle committed to an institution so that he would dig the graves anymore.</p><p>This is a wonderful and delightful film. I was laughing quite out-loud many times throughout, everything is pulled together so masterfully. Just the way in which everyone presents themselves as sane is enough to compliment the acting, and then Cary Grant takes it up another notch with his wonderful performance. This is what screwball comedy is meant to be.</p><p>I recommend this to everyone. If you fail to laugh, then there is something seriously wrong with you.</p>
80352|barbershop|DVD at home|2003-02-27|<p>Calvin runs a barbershop in Chicago, handed down to him from his father two years ago. But Calvin has trouble making ends meet and has some serious property taxes to come up with soon. But there is a loan shark who is willing to take over the shop for Calvin, and reluctantly Calvin takes the man's money. But then he realizes his mistake and has to figure out a way to keep the shop.</p><p>This is a fairly funny film, with enough seriousness to make it warm. Nothing feels out of place, though the overall plot arch isn't exactly complex or unexpected. A lot of different issues come up and get covered in a broad and decent manner.</p><p>This film is worth checking out. If you get the DVD, be sure to watch the cut scenes, because the one introducing the west African fellow is a riot.</p>
80353|cradle2thegrave|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2003-03-01|<p>A team of thieves steal a diamond shipment in L.A. An agent from Taiwan stops one of them from getting away with the regular diamonds, but they do make it away with a bag of black diamonds that they'd been hired to nab. But with their former boss betraying them, they look for another way to move the stones. Very quickly, they are in up to their necks, trying just to stay alive.</p><p>This movie has everything one expects it to have, and isn't by any means meant to be taken seriously. The fight scenes are pretty good, Jet Li playing the silent and violent type. The final fight scene within a ring of fire is getting old, though, especially in this case where it is so blatantly not real (you can see the strips that shoot out the fire). And I have to say, Gabrielle Union is definitely a pleasure to watch.</p><p>This is a film for Jet Li and genre fans. It is fun, but if you don't think you would like it, then you probably won't.</p>
80354|magnificentbutcher|DVD at friend's house|2003-03-07|<p>Butcher Wing keeps getting into trouble, and his master Wong Fei-Hung has to sort it out. With the master out of town, the butcher becomes involved in a kidnapping case, played off by the kidnappers against the people trying to get the woman back. When he finally figures out the right side to be on and rescues the woman, it only leads to more problems.</p><p>This is a good old-school film. The mix of comedy in with the action is great, with a great deal of innovative ideas coming out. The plot even allows for several surprises, which isn't all that common in these kinds of films. Also amazing is that there is a plot, because it feels like it is non-stop fighting - not that I'm complaining.</p><p>This one's definitely worth checking out. Sammo is top-notch both physically and comedically.</p>
80355|beautyandthebeast|DVD at home|2003-03-08|<p>When a French gentleman picks a rose for his daughter on the way home, the owner of the rose forces him into an agreement. Either he has to come back in three days to be killed, or he has to send one of his children. Belle, the man's only caring child, volunteers, since it was for her the rose was picked. When she arrives, the beast does not kill her but insteads pampers her like a princess within his castle. He wants her to marry him, but she refuses. With time, however, she does come to care for him. But after she returns home for a week, her siblings all plot to kill the Beast and take his treasure.</p><p>That quality of this movie is quite amazing. There are many interesting and innovative things done that make it a pleasure to watch. Some things are a bit confusing at first, but eventually make sense. Overall, for a film from 1946, it is hard not to be impressed.</p><p>This film is really for more serious cinema buffs, and not something I'd recommend to anyone outside the art crowd. It is enjoyable though, and although I'll never see the Disney monstrosity, I get the sense that quite a bit was lifted from this film for that one.</p>
80356|dragoninn|James Bridge Theater at UCLA|2003-03-09|<p>At the frontier establishment of the Dragon Inn, the murderous agents of a powerful imperial eunuch lie in wait for the banished children of an executed rival. The trap, however, is complicated by a series of mysterious warriors who arrive at the inn as meddlesome guests, challenging the official authority of the waiting killers. An exquisite game of cat-and-mouse ensues as each side tests the martial skills of each other, until the exiles arrive and the mounting tension explodes in successive, sword-flashing climaxes that build to the entrace of the reputedly invincible eunuch himself.</p><p>This movie was <short=\"newdragoninn\">remade</a> by Tsui Hark, but that remake cannot even hold a candle to the original (and I like the remake). The interplay of characters and the build-up of tension here is great, it drags you in and leaves you wanting more. The fight scenes are all nice. My only complaint is about the arrows, which seem to come in from just off-screen, thrown by one-year-old children. This doesn't really detract from the film, though.</p><p>This film is definitely one of the greatest, and I recommend it to anyone who can get hold of it. Word was that it was going to be released on DVD following the film festival, so that is something to look forward to.</p>
80357|escortsovertigerhills|James Bridge Theater at UCLA|2003-03-09|<p>Jing Wuji has renounced violence and become a monk, but then comes out of retirement to escort a convoy of Tartar prisoners through enemy territory. His race against time and the enemy is complicated by the infusion of two of his ex-wives, not to mention intrigue and ambush aplenty.</p><p>This is a pretty good production, though it is hard to follow at times. The style is called unique by many, and it was claimed that <short=\"ashesoftime\">Ashes of Time</a> calls back to this film. I have to say that the fighting was much clearer here, and the story more engaging and interesting.</p><p>It does little good to recommend this film to anyone, because it would be quite difficult for anyone to get hold of it. It is rightfully placed among the classics in the development of wuxia cinema, and it is to people interested in that that it holds some value.</p>
80358|undercoverbrother|DVD at home|2003-03-15|<p>Undercover Brother works alone, but when he crosses paths with the Brotherhood, the Brotherhood seeks to recruit him in its fight against The Man. When a famous black general announces his plan to open a chain of fried chicken restaurants instead of his candidacy for presidency, they know that The Man must be behind it, and the race is on to figure out the nefarious plot before black culture is destroyed. But The Man has White She Devil to complicate Undercover Brother's efforts.</p><p>This isn't roll-on-the-floor laughter, but I enjoyed most of the jokes in this film. It is a mix of many different comedic styles, with ample references to black culture and radicalism from the seventies. The film could have been more political, but still delivers. My favorite scene, though, is the x-ray view scene (most likely an homage to the use of the technique in <strong>Romeo Must Die</strong>).</p><p>I'd recommend this to anyone looking for an interesting comedy. It is far better than most of the comedic fluff that Hollywood puts out. The women aren't hard to look at, either.</p>
80359|hero|DVD at friend's house|2003-03-28|<p>The swordsman Nameless has been brought before the first emperor, having slain several assassins who had hoped to take the leader's life. He has the honor of sitting near the emperor as he retells his story of who he has slain and how he did it. But the emperor doesn't quite buy the story, and offers up his own interpretation.</p><p>If you can see this movie on a big screen, do it. This is some of the most amazing cinematography and choreography I have seen in a long time. If they do release it to the theaters here, I will be there. For the time being, I have to settle for the DVD. I think it was worth it.</p><p>The fighting is pretty good, and I actually like the story, though I don't necessarily agree with its conclusions. Of course, when discussing the film with a Chinese woman who had seen the film, she thought that the final message was actually different. I guess you have to interpret it for yourself. In any case, it is a worthwhile ride, with actors I'm always happy to see on  screen.</p>
80360|humanconditioni|DVD at home|2003-04-08|<p>Kaji has avoided serving in the war because of his academic position. He is offered an exclusion from the draft by participating in the colonial administration of a mine in Manchuria. Kaji has \"radical\" ideas, particularly that if workers are treated better they will work better, they will be more productive. Of course, putting this into practice isn't exactly easy when everyone else around him is intent on using brutality against the Chinese workers. And then the military sends them P.O.W.s that Kaji has to apply his principles to.</p><p>This is actually the first two parts of what I believe is a six-part movie. The whole thing is something like nine hours long. This part is interesting, and brings up quite a few interesting issues and situations. The most  intriguing dilemma in my opinion is the fact that Kaji is still helping the Japanese government to carry out the brutal exploitation of the Chinese, while trying to put a nicer feel on it.</p><p>You really have to be committed to want to see these movies. I will probably try to watch the other two segments sometime in the near future, and will hold out on making any final conclusions until then.</p>
80361|moonraker|DVD at home|2003-04-10|<p>When a space shuttle comes up missing, James Bond is sent to find out what happened to it. The first place he heads is to the man who created it, Drax. It becomes obvious that the man is up to something evil, but it takes a while to figure out exactly what. In Venice, he comes across a highly-lethal nerve agent. Then it is off to Brazil. Eventually, together with the U.S. agent Dr. Goodhead, our hero is off to outerspace to prevent Drax from carrying out his sinister plot.</p><p>The best part of this film is the crass joke delivered by Q at the end. Otherwise, this is just a loose string of action scenes that don't motivate the viewer all that much. There is some bad acting and some bad dialogue to make it that much harder to swallow. And then there is the sci-fi elements, which are just laughable.</p><p>This is not a Bond masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. I've heard others say that this is the worst Bond film, and so far I am inclined to agree with them. It's still a Bond film, though.</p>
80362|versus|DVD at friend's house|2003-04-11|<p>I've already seen this <short=\"versus\">film</a>. After waiting around in anticipation that it would be released on DVD here in this country, I broke down and bought the region 2 version.</p>
80363|election|DVD at home|2003-04-12|<p>Jim McAllister is a good high school teacher, proud of what he does. But when Tracy Flick gets on his nerves and he tried to deal with her, things seem to backfire a little. The context is the school elections, and Mr. M convinces another student to run for the position. That then leads to yet another person on the ballot, and everyone has their own agenda.</p><p>The are many funny situations in this movie that are well worth it. It is hard not to get behind the speech given by the younger sister for her run for council president. Some of the contrasts are also quite well done, and there are many times when one feels they can relate to something that is going on. In the end, despite all the humor, the reality of things can be quite depressing, however.</p><p>I'd recommend that people see this film. It isn't groundbreaking, but it is one of the better Hollywood comedies that I've seen from recent years.</p>
80364|angermanagement|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2003-04-12|<p>Dave Buznik is quite timid, getting pushed around and used by his boss and any number of other people. Then on a business flight, the flight attendant interprets his asking about a headset as a violent confrontation... and after the court case he is ordered to attend anger management classes. The classes are run by Dr. Buddy Rydell, a man whose methods are anything but typical. After another incident, Dave is put under 24-hour supervision for the next thirty days.</p><p>From the trailers, I wasn't expecting much of the typical Adam Sandler humor. It is in there, in larger doses than I expected, but the movie still plays out quite well. Some things verge on the absurd, but everything pulls together in the end. I laughed an ample amount, and even had some food for thought when the film was over.</p><p>I liked the film. I know that it isn't for everyone, but if you've liked some of Sandler's more tame films, you'll enjoy this one.</p>
80365|betterlucktomorrow|AMC 14 Theaters, Century City|2003-04-13|<p>Ben is your typical over-achieving, middle-class, suburban teenager. He studies his butt off, and remains at the top of his class in the hopes of getting into a good school. The offer comes up to make some extra money doing crib sheets, which he takes. Soon, he's pulled in his friends Virgil and Han. Together with Daric, they get involved in more and more illegal activities, developing a reputation around the high school. Meanwhile, Ben is courting the finest girl in the school.</p><p>This movie was brought to my attention because someone I know is in it. She didn't have a speaking part, but I guess she did some behind-the-scenes work as well. In any case, I enjoyed the film. It didn't sit well with some, especially the ending that may not satisfy some. I just found the story enjoyable and the characters interesting if not lovable. The use of Asian-American actors in non-ethnic roles is also nice, though for me it doesn't mean much, as I've not been exposed to the stereotypes as much and have real experience to counter such images.</p><p>I'd recommend the film, especially for those young enough to still be in or remember high school. I don't, to be honest, but I liked the film.</p>
80366|infernalaffairs|DVD at friend's house|2003-04-18|<p>Two police cadets choose opposite paths. One becomes Inspector Lau, but is recruited by a triad leader to be a mole inside the police department. The other, Yan, seems to have been kicked out of the academy, but in fact becomes a police mole inside the aforementioned triad. After a failed bust, it becomes clear to both sides that they have respective moles. The trick is to find out who is who first, before the other side does.</p><p>I liked this movie very much. I wasn't sure where things were going to lead all the way through to the end. And, in classic Hong Kong tradition, the ending is a morally ambiguous one that doesn't necessarily equate to a happy ending. The acting, script and direction are all superb, and my only complaint is that some of the more attractive side characters didn't get enough screen time, but this isn't a legitimate complaint.</p><p>If you can get your hands on it, check it out. I believe it was the highest grossing film in Hong Kong for 2002, and it was with good reason.</p>
80367|rikyu|DVD at home|2003-04-20|<p>Rikyu is a master of the tea ceremony and teacher of the art to Japan's ruler, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He is respected by many, but being so close to the top of power he is untrusted by many. Whether out of ignorance or some absolute morality, Rikyu often acts without regard for political reality, and it effects himself and those around him.</p><p>This movie bored me, but somehow didn't manage to put me to sleep. I cannot even put my finger on what made me keep watching. I actually fast forwarded through the last two-thirds of the film. The subtitles were hard-coded, and with the extremely slow pacing I was able to watch it at double-speed without having to stop because the subtitles were too quick. In the end, it just wasn't worth it. Rikyu was not a respectable character for me, and I held no sympathy for anyone in the film.</p><p>I definitely don't recommend this film. I cannot think of anyone who would derive any value from it. It's just a slow art film.</p>
80368|made|DVD at home|2003-04-20|<p>Bobby drive and provides protection to strippers, one of which is his girlfriend. He seems to be truly in love with her and her young daughter. But after forcefully removing the tooth of a client who got too hands-on for his tastes, the boss wants to move him into a different line of business. Bobby insists that his friend Ricky should be included, despite everyone's apprehension. Their job. To go to New York and be there when a drop is made, simple toughs.</p><p>This one made it into my queue through the recommendations of others. It did turn out to be quite a good movie. Both of the main characters are quite funny in their own ways. Ricky is just amazing, a persona that just never ceases to amaze. The story also maintains a serious and endearing element as well.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film. The mix of humor and drama make it an excellent film.</p>
80369|jsa|DVD at home|2003-04-26|<p>Major Sophie Lang of the Neutral Nations is called in to oversee an incident at the border between north and south Korea. South Korean soldier Sgt. Lee has confessed to killing two North Korean border guards and wounding a third. His story is that he was kidnapped and fought his way to freedom. Sgt. Oh, the wounded North Korean soldier, corroborates this story, but there are holes in it. Both nations need a resolution that puts neither at fault and prevents the outbreak of complete war.</p><p>An amazing film that works in a sequence of flashbacks to fill in the audience as to what really happened. The movie has the same goal as the investigator, to display both sides in a light that ultimately does not fault either directly but still promotes the ever elusive goal of unity of the unjustly divided nation. It is hard to talk much about the film without giving away those elements of the film that make it an absolute gem.</p><p>This film is definitely worth seeing for everyone, not just fans of Korean or foreign films. If I get in the mood to see this movie again, I will probably purchase it, it was that good.</p>
80370|goldeneye|DVD at home|2003-04-28|<p>A state-of-the-art helicopter is stolen that is immune to electrical attacks. Then, the helicopter shows up in Siberia at a supposedly abandoned station. When the satellite feed suddenly shuts off and the migs sent to investigate go down, the British government knows that the once theoretical goldeneye electro-magnetic pulse weapon does in fact exist. Now, for Bond to track it down before it is used again and to figure out who is behind it.</p><p>I hadn't seen this film since it was released in theaters (in Japan). I actually hadn't really intended to see it again so soon, since there are many older Bond films I haven't seen yet, but then I mixed up my queue. In any case, I enjoyed the film. Brosnan makes an excellent Bond. My primary complaint about the film is Ms. Janssen's role, which was just a bit too much for me. The finest moment in the film, however, is Q's first bit. I had to rewind and watch that again, it was so good.</p><p>As a friend has pointed out, the modern Bond films have really degenerated. The end of the film is just a fist fight between Bond and the bad guy, instead of the intelligent defeat of a mastermind. That said, the movie is still enjoyable to all the levels that one expects a modern action film to meet. Many of the good Bond elements are still there as well.</p>
80371|x2|Pacific Beach Cities 16|2003-05-03|<p>After a mutant assassination attempt on the President of the United States, a military man named Stryker comes in with a proposal to deal with the \"mutant problem\" more aggressively. Luring Professor Xavier and Cyclops into a trap and descending upon the school, the remaining X-Men have to figure out what is happening before all mutant-kind are destroyed. Magneto, escaped from prison, wants to make sure they get it right.</p><p>Sure, there are problems with the movie, but I still liked it a lot. Without the burden of introducing so many characters, there was time to develop some of the more. I particularly liked Mystique, who has some great lines. It was refreshing that Storm wasn't spewing the worst dialogue in film history, as well. I liked that the film necessarily has to touch on interesting political and social issues (though it avoids an important one with the change in Stryker from the comic book - a televangelist).</p><p>For me, the most disappointing part of the film was the fight between Oyama Yuriko and Logan, which was both pointless and anti-climactic. Since it didn't feel like it had a point, it was hard for me to get excited about it. I found Logan's wading through the soldiers who attack the school much more satisfying.</p><p>This is about the best comic-book movie that I expect to see for a while. There are a number of other ones in the works, or that have come out recently, that just aren't worth the time, but this one is fun and even thought-provoking. I definitely recommend it.</p>
80372|yesmadam|DVD at home|2003-05-03|<p>The microfilm that incriminates a major crime boss has come up missing. It ends up in the hands of three friends who are pretty much incompetent. Michelle is the cop trying to track it down, and Cynthia is the foreign cop who is supposed to help her. Now it is just a question of finding the evidence before the women lose their jobs and their lives.</p><p>For the most part, this film is annoying. The male characters just got on my nerves, and the female characters were a little too cartoonish in their actions and motivations. Yes, the movie has some fine action and fight scenes, but it didn't really make it worth it. After seeing this movie, I actually made sure I didn't have any movies in my queue that were there just because Michelle Yeoh starred in them. There were a couple trailers attached to the DVD that were clearly lame films. This doesn't negate the fact that she's an attractive woman who I enjoy watching kick butt on screen, but that's not enough.</p><p>I think my tolerance for films is beginning to drop again. For an 80s Hong Kong film, this one isn't all that atypical. It should please those who enjoy that era of film. I'm just looking to glean the best elements, though.</p>
80373|threedaysofthecondor|DVD at home|2003-05-04|<p>Joseph Turner works for the CIA, reading books published throughout the world in case they contain codes. Then one day while he is out picking up lunch, everyone at his field office is murdered. When he calls in to report, the rendezvous turns out to be an attempt to kill him as well. He takes a random person hostage in order to hide at her place, making himself harder to track down while he tries to figure out what is going on.</p><p>I'd heard about the movie some time ago, but just never seemed to get around to watching it. It was definitely enjoyable, building up the mystery of what really is going on. The most satisfying thing is, of course, that the bad guy is actually a bad guy in the real world, and thus the movie can build upon some realism even while taking other obvious liberties.</p><p>This movie is definitely worth checking out. It does have a happy ending, but even that isn't as 'perfect' as they usually are for these kinds of films. Certainly one of the better political thrillers of the time.</p>
80374|sentochihironomakimakushi|DVD at home|2003-05-05|<p>Chihiro and her family are moving, something which she is very much against. Before they get to their new home, though, a short cut lands them in an abandoned amusement park. Before she knows it, Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs and she is trapped in a spirit world. She has to figure out who she can trust and grow up before she can rescue her parents and return to the real world.</p><p>This movie did very little for me. The animation is amazing, as one would expect, but that's really where it ends for me. The main character is unsympathetic. All-in-all, this is just a story about growing up that has been wrapped in Japanese myths. Miyazaki has made far better films - those should have been given Oscars over this one.</p><p>I don't really recommend this one. If whiny, pouty little girls are your thing, maybe it won't annoy you.</p>
80375|armageddon|DVD at home|2003-05-09|<p>An asteroid is heading toward earth and will result in total human extinction if nothing is done about it. So the bright idea they come up with at NASA is to send a team to drill into the rock and set off a nuclear bomb, causing the asteroid to split and miss the earth. Of course, if they are going to drill, they want to get the best men on the job... which turn out to be a load of roughnecks.</p><p>In a just society, Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer would be taken out into the streets and shot in the back of the head. This would be done publicly to set an example to all who might think to follow their path. These two men epitomize everything that could be wrong with a Hollywood film.</p><p>By the way, I hated this film. I'm not sure who the people were who recommended it to me at whatever point. Even the eye candy known as Liv Tyler was spoiled by the fact that she was paired up with Ben Affleck. I'm not sure where to begin with this thing, but the patriotic scenes made me want to vomit. Even little things annoyed me, like the fact that all the meteors seem to hit only the largest, most important cities in the world - or that when the asteroid is destroyed it just happens to be midday in India, the Middle-East, Europe and the United States all at the same time.</p><p>If you haven't seen this film and are seriously thinking about it, do the world a favor and go shoot yourself in the head. It will be a much more pleasant experience, believe me.</p>
80376|thesting|DVD at home|2003-05-13|<p>Johnny and his pals grift a guy for a fairly large sum of money, but it turns out the guy was the runner for the mafia. When his pals are killed, he has to run to Chicago. There, he meets up with one of the best, Henry Gondorf, who helps arrange a sting that will get revenge upon the man responsible for killing his friends.</p><p>A movie about grifting would be hard to screw up, and this one doesn't even come close to that mistake. The soundtrack is great. The acting is good, and the plot and characters are top-notch. It was nice to feel good about having watched a film, and of course nice to be able to root for people who aren't exactly \"good-guys\" in the traditional sense of the term.</p><p>This is a must-see for all film fans. I'm not sure what my excuse was for taking so long to finally see it. My recently re-sparked interest in confidence men is what push me over the edge.</p>
80377|strangersonatrain|DVD at home|2003-05-17|<p>Guy, an up-and-coming tennis star, meets Bruno on the train. Bruno imposes himself on Guy, eventually explaining to him his idea of the perfect murder. But Bruno thinks that Guy has agreed to the arrangement, and kills Guy's wife - who he's been trying to divorce anyway. Guy cannot go to the police, or he faces jail time himself for the crime, but he also cannot seem to get Bruno out of his life until he takes care of his end of the bargain.</p><p>The truly nice thing about this movie is that it sets up the scenarios in a believable manner. The characters take actions that would normally seem absurd (although we accept them in action films, more often than not). But, because of the way things are set up, suddenly the actions taken do seem like the most rational choice to make. Hitchcock just knew how to make films. Classics like these are refreshing at a time when many modern movies are soarly lacking in believable plots.</p><p>Definitely check this one out, especially if you are already a Hitchcock fan. If you watch the DVD, make sure to watch the British version, and then go back and watch the U.S. ending, which has an additional scene at the end that is quite funny.</p>
80378|mywifeisagangster|DVD at home|2003-05-17|<p>Mantis is an important and legendary enforce in the mafia. But when she finally tracks down her long lost sister, she is suffering a terminal illness. In a pledge to her sister, she promises to marry. The problem is, virginal Mantis doesn't even know where to begin. When a mate is finally found for her, she doesn't exactly acclimate to married life.</p><p>I liked this movie a lot. I'd heard a wide range of reviews of it, and the person who lent it to me didn't like it at all. But I thought it was pulled off very well. The actress who plays Mantis does an excellent job, and her facial expressions are often enough to make you laugh. If you have some understanding of Korean social standards, there might be more in the film for you, but even without that understanding there is plenty to laugh at.</p><p>I'd recommend this to most people who like foreign comedies. I'd heard a rumor that an American remake was being hammered out, and if that is the case, definitely see the original, because Cameron Diaz (slated for the lead role) would most definitely suck at it.</p>
80379|trainspotting|New Beverly Cinema|2003-05-23|<p>Renton is a heroin addict in Edinburgh, Scotland. He'd like to kick the habit, but his friend and the general misery of his life work against him. Even a court-imposed rehabilitation fails, forcing his parents to take the tough love approach. Cleaned up, he heads to London for a straight job, but his friends won't leave him alone, drawing him back into the lifestyle whether he likes it or not.</p><p>I'd actually seen this movie five or six years ago on video. I'd liked it at the time, but with my poor memory the only thing that stuck with me was the last scene of him walking away as the music played (still need to buy the soundtrack for that song). The movie is quite witty and gives an interesting glimpse into a particular reality. I probably enjoyed it more this time around.</p><p>If you've not seen it, I would recommend checking it out. It's one of those movies for me that's right on the edge of purchase, though I'll probably never buy it, since I haven't yet.</p>
80380|italianjob|Pacific Beach Cities 16|2003-05-31|<p>After a successful gold heist in Venice, one member of the crew decides that he wants all the gold. With the death of the father-figure of the group, the rest dream of revenge. One year later, they get information that their betrayer is in Los Angeles and moving the gold. Now, they need to figure out how to steal the gold back and screw the betrayer all in one blow.</p><p>This film is nothing more than it pretends to be, and in that it is quite good. The action is put together well, the characters are likeable, and there is some witty and fun dialogue. If you are looking to turn your brain off and just enjoy a film, this is certainly a good recommendation.</p>
80381|matrixreloaded|Pacific Beach Cities 16|2003-05-31|<p>The aliens who use farm humans as batteries have begun drilling toward Zion, signaling the end of free human existence if they cannot be stopped. Neo is thought by many to be the \"one\" - a messiah who will defeat the aliens once and for all. But Neo needs the help of a number of people in order to solve the riddle of the matrix.</p><p>The film was alright. It took me several weeks just to work up the motivation to go see it, and as I expected, the special effects were the main reason to go. The attempts at philosophy would turn the stomach of anyone who has bothered to think through the issues it tries to touch upon. The dialogue with the old representative in Zion just had me shaking my head. The ending, of course, leaves little room for guessing what's going to ultimately happen in the next film. For me, the most trying part was the fight scenes. Granted, there were some nice moves and I could see the good work that Yuen Woo Ping does. But, they were too long... or at least they were too long given what I know about Neo. There is just no reason for him to carry on as long as he does (without even going into why).</p><p>I'll go to see the third film, like the sucker I am (for closure?), but if you haven't seen this film yet, there's really isn't a good reason to change that situation now. Everyone else has already seen it.</p>
80382|getcarter|DVD at home|2003-06-01|<p>Carter's brother has been killed, but his mafia superiors advise against him getting involved, accepting the police report that it was a suicide. When Carter gets home, he has trouble getting the information he needs. Lot of people won't give straight answers, and others just avoid answering all together. But when Carter finds out what really happened, heads are going to roll.</p><p>I'd not heard of this film until the remake a few years ago. There was no way I was going to see that, but when I found out that Michael Caine was in the original, it sparked my interest. This is definitely a seventies film, with slower pacing than we've come to expect from this type of film. It isn't amazing in any way, but still enjoyable to watch.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to too many people, but it isn't a waste of time. If you like Caine as an actor, then it is worth checking out.</p>
80383|killingfields|DVD at home|2003-06-14|<p>New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg arrives in Cambodia as the Khmer Rouge is growing and the secret U.S. bombings continue. He hooks up with Cambodian journalist Dith Pran. When everything begins to crumble in 1975, Pran's family is evacuated from the country, but the two journalists stay to record what will happen. When Sydney if finally forced to flee, Pran cannot, and we soon see some of the extent of the Khmer Rogue regime.</p><p>Although the political themes and messages of this film were not explored as deeply as they could have been, it is still an excellent movie. You do get a glimpse of the horror that was Cambodia during the seventies. The film composition is also of high quality, with excellent cinematography and acting. Certainly a movie everyone should see.</p><p>Definite recommendation. It could have been more powerful, but still quite impressive for political and historical drama of the 1980s.</p>
80384|goldfinger|DVD at home|2003-06-25|<p>MI6 suspects Auric Goldfinger of smuggling gold out of the country, but does not have any hard evidence. So, they put James Bond on the case. But Bond finds out that there is more than just some smuggling going on, as Goldfinger prepares for Operation Grand Slam, which we come to find out involves Fort Knox.</p><p>This is perhaps one of the most famous Bond films there is. I know I'd seen it as a kid, but didn't remember much more than Odd-Job and the laser scene. The real beauty of this film is that Bond isn't so masterfully in control of the situation as he so often is in other movies. The villains are still a bit silly, but definitely fun. And who can complain about a character named Pussy Galore, perhaps the raunchiest name in Bond history.</p><p>If you are a Bond fan, then this is must-see. Even if you aren't, this is perhaps one of the best examples of Connery as Bond.</p>
80385|spellbound|DVD at home|2003-06-28|<p>Dr. Constance Peterson faces the sexists presures typical of a woman in a professional position, working at a mental hospital. She has also turned away amorous intentions from her colleagues and superiors. When a new director is appointed to the hospital, Dr. Edwards, she somehow falls for him. But Dr. Edwards isn't who he seems. As it becomes clear that the real Dr. Edwards is missing, the police are out to find the primary suspect.</p><p>Despite the clues that are set up, I just completely missed this one and it took me a while to figure out what was going on. That's a good thing. While some parts of the film are endearing, other parts are a little unbelievable - Ingrid Bergman's character being the hardest to accept. I still liked it, and it is an enjoyable twist of romance and mystery.</p><p>Not the finest example of old cinema, but it is still Hitchcock and the story itself is interesting.</p>
80386|28dayslater|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2003-06-29|<p>Animal-rights activists break into a laboratory to release chimps who are being experimented upon. Unfortunately, the chimps are infected with the rage virus. The virus is spread by saliva and blood, but once you are infected, you tend to start spewing blood on others. You also go into a violent rage and try to attack other people. Twenty-eight days after the virus is let loose upon Britain, bike messenger Jim wakes up from a coma to find that the world has gone to pot since he was in an accident.</p><p>This movie got such good reviews that perhaps I got my expectations up a little too high. The shining feature of this film is its realism. Once you have accepted the idea of the rage virus, the rest of the movie seems to follow from what you would expect would happen in the real world. For me, the questions it brings up are all after the movie, not within it. I cannot say, however, that they are particularly deep or provocative questions, and I've yet to have any real discussions about the movie with other people who saw it.</p><p>I probably wouldn't recommend the film, though I liked it. It just left me with a sensation that, yeah, I'd seen it, and it was done well, but it didn't land definitely in any one camp of needs I expect to be fulfilled by watching a movie. If the movie sounds interesting to you, go ahead and seen it. I don't imagine anyone will be bitter about having watched it.</p>
80387|gonewiththewind|DVD at home|2003-06-30|<p>Scarlett O'Hara is a Southern Belle who is used to getting everyone's attention, but on the eve of the Civil War her neighbor is announcing his engagement to someone else. As the Civil War brings an end to the lifestyle of the Southern aristocrat, Scarlett has to deal with the deaths of those around her and trying to maintain her own existence. Rhett Butler keeps coming into her life, but she resists him along the way because they are too much alike.</p><p>Yes, this is the first time I've actually seen this film. It was probably only recently that I even considered it, and having it lent to me by an officemate facilitated it. I'm amazed at how well preserved the film is, and how bright the colors still come across. As for the story, well, it's OK. I found the acting to be a mixed bag. There are some moments when Vivien and Clark both shine, but then there were other times when Vivien's performance really ranked up there with B-movie actresses. Her final line was just bad, in my opinion.</p><p>I was also troubled by the characters. They seem to have two or three personalities that have internal consistency, but then switch unexpectedly. Rhett's joining the army was a major point of confusion for me. Scarlett just seems to change here and there, making her already unsympathetic character unbelievable. There are times, however, when the characters are really respectable for being what they are.</p><p>It was an interesting film, but I cannot say I'd recommend it to other people. Being the film buff I am, I probably would have seen it anyway, but now that I know the story I don't think I would have watched it if I knew more about it coming into it.</p>
80388|mycousinvinny|DVD at home|2003-07-03|<p>Bill and Stan are mistaken for murderers as they pass through a Southern town. When Bill calls home, the only help his mother can send is his cousin Vinny, who is a lawyer. Unfortunately, he's not a trial lawyer and doesn't have the slightest idea about how to go about conducting himself in a murder trial.</p><p>I found this fairly cheap, so I bought the DVD. This is a very funny film that just fits together very well. The performances are top-notch all around,  and the characters are even fairly believable and in circumstances that aren't too far-fetched. This is one of those films that can just make you feel good no matter what mood you are in.</p><p>Not the greatest comedy ever made, but definitely one with staying power that can be watched again every so often.</p>
80389|12monkeys|DVD at home|2003-07-04|<p>A convict is sent back in time to uncover the mystery of the virus that has killed off most of the human race and driven everyone to live underground. He's following a few leads left behind or relayed by others who have been sent back in time for the same purpose. But when he's sent to the wrong time, he is arrested and treated as if he is insane.</p><p>I think this was another of those films that I missed because I was in Japan. Someone brought it to my attention several years ago, and I really liked it. I bought the DVD a while back, knowing that this is the kind of film I'd like to have around. Terry Gilliam is just a great director with some interesting visions that few other people can even come close to. To top it off, this is also a wonderful story that keeps you wondering and plays with you. Even with this viewing, I was catching things I hadn't noticed before.</p><p>This is a classic and a must-see even if you aren't a Gilliam fan.</p>
80390|shanghainoon|DVD at home|2003-07-09|<p>Chon Wang is a low-level imperial guard who is sent along with other men considered more competent to recover the kidnapped Princess. Princess Pei Pei has been taken to Carson City, where another former imperial guard is hoping to ransom her for a very large sum of gold. When bandits try to rob the train that Chon Wang is on, they kill his uncle and end up setting him off alone to find the Princess. But one of the bandits, Roy O'Bannon, turns out to be his best hope of getting the Princess back.</p><p>I think this is the fourth time I've seen this movie. I saw it twice in the theater (once for free before it was released). It had been a while, though, and when my ex took off with the DVD, I knew it was one I'd have to buy again. My sister was in town and wanted to see it, so I stayed up later than I should have.</p><p>When people talk about chemistry between actors, many times I just don't see it. This is an exception. Owen and Jackie just seem to work well togethers, and the humor that comes out of this is right up my alley. The actions scenes a creative, and the situations they find themselves in are just hilarious. Part of the charm here is, of course, the anachronism, the tongue-in-cheek references to things that clearly aren't quite right.</p><p>This is a must, perhaps Jackie's best American offering so far. There are plans, I hear, for a third movie, but I'll reserve comment on that until it is actually threatening to be in the theaters.</p>
80391|fullthrottle|Pacific Beach Cities 16|2003-07-13|<p>The angels recover a U.S. government official from Mongolia, but the ring he carries is missing. Then the matching ring which contains the information on people placed in the witness protection program is stolen as well. The angels must find out who has the rings and recover them before the information is sold off to the mafia families who would gladly use the information to take care of all the stool pigeons.</p><p>Plot... wow, there actually was one. Is that why I went to see this film? No, absolutely not. The story is not as important as the set-up. This is pretty much non-stop action and jokes, and for the most part the film delivers what I expected. As the film approaches the end, perhaps the last third, there are times when things slow down, but otherwise, everything else is completely over-the-top. This film doesn't even try to be realistic, and if you don't appreciate that, you won't like it.</p><p>Compared to the <short=\"charliesangels\">first film</a>, this one does what it sets out to do. The first one just failed at the very things this one pulls off. But this is pure candy, with no nutritional value, and you have to go in with that perspective.</p>
80392|nursebetty|DVD at home|2003-07-14|<p>After witnessing the murder of her husband, Betty goes into a shock that causes her to think that a soap opera is real and that the main doctor is her ex-fiance. She then sets off to track him down, realizing that they were meant to be. Unfortunately, the hitmen who killed her husband cannot afford to have a witness running around, and so they set out to track her down.</p><p>When this came out, it didn't grab my attention, mostly because of the whole notion of someone thinking a soap opera was real. But this movie is quite funny, and the premise it is based on is buyable with a little bit of disbelief suspension. Ren&#233;e is fun and beautiful, as always, but it is the other people in the film who did it for me. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock deliver some great laughs, and the other people who have to react to Betty's state do wonderful jobs.</p><p>I'd recommend this for anyone looking for a nice, light comedy. I sometimes think that movies just haven't been as good lately, but this is one that surprises. It isn't going to be a classic, exactly, but still worth the watch.</p>
80393|themindtraveller|Video at home|2003-07-19|<p>This documentary is part of a series, and this one concentrates upon Tourette's Syndrome and Shane Fistel. Shane is an artist living in Toronto. He wasn't diagnosed until he was a teenager. He does not have much of the shouting that is most commonly associated with the disorder, but instead is obsessed with touching things and is prone to quick and unexpected motions.</p><p>I actually watched this as research for a role-playing character I might run, but I'm also interested in the disorder as well. I read <strong>Motherless Brooklyn</strong> recently, which is a great book about a guy with Tourette's who also is a small-time gangster. In any case, this documentary did provide some useful information. Oliver Sacks comes across a little odd at times, but what do I know?</p><p>If you are interested in learning about Tourette's Syndrome, then this is a good introductory documentary. The best information, however, is probably still found in books.</p>
80394|femaleconvictscorpion|DVD at home|2003-07-20|<p>Matsu, known as Sasori (Scorpion) to fellow inmates, has been in solitary confinement for a year. She's pulled out when an inspector comes. But when she tries to take out the warden's other eye in front of the inspector and the other women riot, the warden wants to punish them appropriately. His idea is to have four prison guards rape her in front of everyone. But then she escapes with six other women, and the chase is on.</p><p>This is a cult classic, of sorts, but I was still a little hesitant to watch it. Japanese movies have less hesitation in depicting the degradation of women, and I wasn't sure which direction this one would go. Fortunately, the film isn't so exploitative as it surely could have been. Sasori's rape scene is mostly comic, but isn't graphic. The other one is as tasteful and gets the director's point across. Basically, this film does fall into the camp of B-movie, but is trying to address social issues. The questions are how Japanese society has judged these women and who is really responsible. Along the way, we get to see some bad-ass women kick some male ass.</p><p>I cannot say I'd recommend this film to anyone unless I knew they were already into cult films. It has that camp value, and I guess it has had influence on other directors, but it doesn't have such a great value that I think most people should sit through it.</p>
80395|punchdrunklove|DVD at home|2003-07-21|<p>Barry Egan is a small-business owner in Sherman Oaks with seven sisters who constantly harass him about his lack of a social life. But Barry is socially inept, and doesn't appear to have ever had a girlfriend. A phone-sex call gets the people on the other end of the line to thinking they can extort him. Meanwhile, a friend of one of his sisters comes into his life and gives him something to fight for.</p><p>This is an art film that doesn't have Adam Sandler doing any of this typical humor. There are funny moments in the film, but it is more quirky than humorous. It is a romance, though, about a guy who many people just aren't going to understand. There is certainly a lot of symbolism, and the music certainly adds to an understanding of the richer meaning of the film. I have to admit that I'll need to watch the DVD extras before I feel like I could weigh in with anything more significant, because I cannot explain many of the things that go on. Unlike some critics, though, I do think that Sandler's character is realistic and based on neurosis that some of us have to deal with.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but I know that some people will appreciate it. One just needs to understand that the quirky, artistic elements outweigh the romantic elements, and you should go in with an interest in that aspect of the film.</p>
80396|princessbride|DVD at work|2003-07-22|<p>After falling in love, Westley has to leave to find his fortune so that he can afford to marry Buttercup. But she receives a report that his ship is captured by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Five years later, she has been selected to marry the Prince, although she does not love him. The Prince, of course, is only hoping to use her death to start a war, until someone intervenes.</p><p>I cannot count the number of times I've seen this film. It is classic, and I actually own the DVD, but figured it would be fun to watch it with my coworkers during lunch. This is one of those films that people like to quote from often, and so it should be watched if only so that you have the frame of reference. It is a wonderful mix of humor and romance that only a curmudgeon wouldn't like. Everyone should see it.</p>
80397|sidandnancy|DVD at home|2003-07-26|<p>After Nancy's dead body is carried out of a New York apartment and Sid is being questioned by the police as to who the woman is and where he met her, we are sent back to the early days of the Sex Pistols. Already of dubious talent, when Sid meets Nancy, she gets him hooked onto heroin and becomes even more useless as a bandmember. He's good at attracting attention, though, and that's what the Sex Pistols was all about. After the band breaks up while on tour in the U.S., Sid reunites with Nancy and spends some time in Paris before returning to New York to end their days.</p><p>Other than owning their first album, I knew very little about the Sex Pistols going into this film. I didn't really pick up much from it, either, history-wise, though it made me curious. The movie itself felt a little slow, but I didn't get bored. You know from the first scene, though, that it isn't going to be an uplifting movie. The music is done well, and I was surprised to learn that Gary Oldman was actually singing on a couple of the tracks.</p><p>I'd not watch this film again, not so much because it is depressing but because the main characters just aren't appealing. The acting is good and the story put together well, such that I'd recommend the film to someone who was interested in the actual personalities involved. But, if you've no interest in Sid Vicious and the Sex Pistols, it probably isn't worth your time.</p>
80398|jazzepisodeone|Video at home|2003-07-28|<p>Out of the cultural mix of New Orleans of the nineteenth century, blacks invent jazz in the 1890s. Over the next couple decades, the art form brews and spreads slowly, but truly takes off when the first album is pressed in 1917. The music and dancing are already spreading, infecting white middle-class youth as well as blacks. But the white band that claims to be the \"creators\" of jazz help fuel its explosion during World War I.</p><p>I've had an interest in jazz since at least the fifth grade, but have never really fed that interest much more than purchasing a couple CDs. Taking up swing dancing recently, I've also begun to do more research into the music. And, what better place to start that this documentary. Hopefully over the next few months I'll catch all of them.</p><p>As a documentary, it seems pretty good so far. I've heard complaints about it, but those criticism applied to the later part of the series. This first episode is quite good, introducing me to the roots of jazz, which I just had no idea about. The only thing missing that I'm still interested in is the musical structure jazz uses that sets it apart from other kinds of music. This may not, however, get discussed at any point in the documentary, since the information will only mean something if you've had musical training.</p><p>So far, I'd recommend the documentary if you are interested at all in the history of jazz. It is a better medium than a book for this kind of subject matter, since you get the music along with the explanations and pictures.</p>
80399|jazzepisodetwo|Video at home|2003-07-29|<p>As the first jazz album is pressed, the musical form is starting to spread out of New Orleans, particularly into Chicago and New York. In the early twenties, Louis Armstrong is invited to Chicago, where he makes a definite impression and begins putting his sound on vinyl. New York City sees the arrival of Duke Ellington. As white kids start heading to the black clubs to hear the best musicians, there are also classically trained musicians who are looking to develop a more symphonic jazz.</p><p>Although a large chunk of the film covers the lives of Armstrong and Ellington, it still gives a fairly robust presentation of the years from the U.S. entry into World War I and into the mid-twenties. At the end, it leaves us with the temptation of swing, which is starting to emerge.</p>
80400|coalminersdaughter|DVD at home|2003-08-04|<p>Loretta Webb is a young woman in Butcher Hollow, daughter of a coal miner, when she is wooed by significantly older Doolittle \"Mooney\" Lynn. Quickly breaking both of his promised to her parents, he takes her off to Washington where they quickly have several children. Impressed by Loretta's singing, Doo buys her a guitar as an anniversary gift and encourages her. When it is clear her talent is something that could take her far, they work hard to make Loretta Lynn one of the greatest Country singers ever.</p><p>Although I was never a huge fan of Loretta Lynn, this is one of those movies I'd been wanting to see for a long time. According to Loretta, the film is fairly accurate, and it does do a good job of showing the kinds of conditions she (and certainly thousands of other aspiring musicians) came from and passed through. Sissy Spacek also gives a truly amazing performance.</p><p>This is really a movie for fans. The story itself is a little shallow, feeling like some things are probably missing in order to get a fuller picture. I'd not recommend it to anyone not interested in learning more about Loretta Lynn, but if that is your interest it is worth checking out.</p>
80401|shaolinsoccer|DVD at home|2003-08-05|<p>I've already reviewed this <short=\"shaolinsoccer\">movie</a> after I first bought it. Since a coworker wanted to borrow it, it put me in the mood to watch it again before I lent it out. The movie is still worth watching, and definitely see the Hong Kong version (should the dubbed version ever make it to release here in the U.S., as they keep threatening to do).</p>
80402|tombstone|DVD at home|2003-08-05|<p>Wyatt Earp and his two brothers move to Tombstone, Arizona, to start a new life apart from the risk of law enforcement. But the conditions of the west are such that that is easier said than done. The Cowboys, a gang that is truly above the law in most places, are not about to be restricted in their usual habits just because of a few nobodies. With the help of Tuberculosis-ridden Doc Holliday, a gunfight at the O.K. Corral means that only one of the two groups can remain in existence.</p><p>In all honesty, I don't know that much about the actual events (to the extent that they are even known) of Wyatt Earp's life. This movie clearly fictionalizes things, but has plenty of fun doing it. Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer both provide excellent efforts at bringing their characters to life, and there is a pleasant mix of humor and action throughout the film.</p><p>This movie is worth checking out for anyone who likes Westerns mixed with over-the-top action and heroics (nineties-style, not fifties-style). Watch it when you just want to have some fun.</p>
80403|ringu|DVD at home|2003-08-05|<p>Asakawa Reiko is investigating what she thinks is an urban legend about a videotape. After viewing it, the phone will ring, then the viewer has one week left to live. When they die, the death is horrible and unexplained. Reiko's niece dies, and as she is attending the funeral, she hears some of her niece's teenage classmates talking about the death and its connection to the legend. Reiko tracks down the video, but after she watches it, she is on the clock. Calling in her psychic ex-husband, she hopes to unravel everything before she leaves her young son an orphan.</p><p>I'm not one frightened easily, and this movie is no exception. The plot twists and turns, however, make this an enjoyable movie to watch. The real horror by the end of the film is not the threat from the supernatural, but the horror which is within human beings. The end makes this film a real stinger, and if the premise of the film strikes you as interesting, it will probably be worth watching. The production quality and acting are definitely up to par, which should be expected from a movie based on a book that had already been a sensation.</p>
80404|jazzepisodethree|Video at home|2003-08-05|<p>Continuing with the development of Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, who are the centerpieces, this episode covers the early Twenties and the emergence of the jazz age. It follows several artists, black and white, who leave their mark and represent many of the people being attracted to the art form.</p><p>Like the previous episodes, this one is of rather high quality.</p>
80405|starshiptroopers|DVD at friend's house|2003-08-07|<p>Johnny Rico doesn't have to join the army, doesn't need to become a citizen, because his parents are wealthy enough to provide him the path to a decent life. But Rico's highschool sweetheart has aspirations of being a starship commander, so he follows her into military service. Being absolutely mediocre, he is assigned to mobile infantry, i.e. cannon fodder. Then the military government that controls the Earth manufacture a war against the alien menace, destroying Buenos Aires (our protagonists' home town).</p><p>This is political satire pure and simple. Admittedly, I don't think the movie was as good as <short=\"robocop\">Robocop</a>, Paul Verhoeven's real masterpiece of satire and social commentary, but it is still quite good. Just seeing Neil Patrick Harris walking around in an SS uniform (without the emblems, of course), should be enough to tell you that this is not just a special-effect extravaganza. Of course, like <short=\"robocop\" title=\"Robocop\">Robocop</a>, this movie had sequels made to it which clearly drive home the ignorance of the Hollywood executives who funded the film to begin with.</p><p>If you are looking for a very funny action film that will get you thinking about the very nature of our society and how it goes about conducting wars (particularly relevant right now), this movie is definitely worth checking out.</p>
80406|seeingred|Video at friend's house|2003-08-17|<p>This documentary interviews rank-and-file members of the Communist Party USA who joined the movement in the thirties. Some of them have since left the party, but few have given up their conviction that there is something seriously wrong with capitalism. The interviews break things into segments. First, people are asked why the joined the party in the first place. Later it deals with the individual experiences during the McCarthy witchhunts. Following that is the Kruchev revelation, which is really what diminished party membership in the fifties. Finally, we see where everyone is at the time of the making of the documentary.</p><p>This is a must-see documentary, one that covers facts that are little touched in this society but need to be known. The people in this documentary and their attitudes are truly and inspiration to everyone.</p>
80407|pinkpanther|DVD at home|2003-08-18|<p>A jewel thief known as the Phantom has been striking the rich during their social parties. Inspector Clouseau is in Rome because he suspects that the next target will be the Pink Panther, an immense diamond owned by Princess Dala. But besides being bumbling, Clouseau is also a bit clueless, since it turns out that his wife is a major player in the cat-and-mouse game.</p><p>This is a particular kind of humor, but the slap-stick is actually not all of it. There are many other kinds of jokes which help round out the film. Some things are a bit absurd, but then that is what we expect from a comedy, and nothing grated on my nerves as being a little too much. The twists and turns turn out to be rather delightful, and it is understandable why they ended up making several more of these films.</p><p>I don't put this in the category of must-see, but I definitely would recommend it to most people. It is light-hearted with a fun ending that will make for a good evening movie to make you laugh.</p>
80408|casadelosbabys|Egyptian Theatre|2003-08-21|<p>Six women come from the U.S. to a Latin American country to adopt babies. They all come for different reasons, but they are thrown together by the fact that they must stay in the country while they wait to meet the government requirements. They stay at a hotel run by a woman whose husband has long since left her and whose son is influenced by more radical ideas. We get a glimpse into the life of one of the maids, as well as an unemployed man who is looking to get ahead. Meanwhile, on the streets, homeless children struggle to survive.</p><p>Like many of John Sayles films, there is not central plot that is so fundamental, but rather a situation that connects many people. Along the way, we get an insight into the situation and lives of a number of people. I liked the movie very much, and although it felt a little too brief, I did get a sense that I understood the characters and some of their motivations. Or perhaps the best way to put it would be that I could empathize with most of them. Compared to his last film, <short=\"sunshinestate\">Sunshine State</a>, I liked this one much better, since the ending (although not resolving much) still feels natural.</p><p>I stand by my belief that John Sayles is the greatest director working in the U.S. today. Thus, it should come as no surprise that I recommend that everyone see his films. He has a sensibility that few others even approach.</p>
80409|kingofnewyork|DVD at home|2003-08-24|<p>Frank White gets out of prison and immediately sets about re-establishing his criminal empire. In his way are at least three other gangs that have grown in strength during his absence. Also there are the police, who really have it in for him - some willing to go to greater lengths than others. Meanwhile, White is planning to take some of the money he earns to help build a hospital in the poor community.</p><p>This is an over-the-top film where the protagonist isn't a good guy. The story itself is not the least bit surprising, but the acting can throw you. Both Walken and Fishburne play roles that are just too much to believe. Walken's White ends up being rather funny, while Fishburne's acting just came across as too clownish for me. There is, however, a great dialogue at the end of the film, when Walken explains why the police should leave him alone when compared to the gang lords he has taken out.</p><p>I couldn't recommend this film to anyone, but I did like it enough to not regret having watched it. The flow of events does keep you interested and has a certain allure of its own, but the over-the-top style just didn't do it for me here.</p>
80410|thevisitors|DVD at home|2003-08-25|<p>Godefroy de Papincourt is a knight under King Louis VI, but when he kills the father of his betrothed he seeks out the wizard for a solution that will allow him to continue with his marriage plans and let him carry on his line. But the wizard is senile and mixes up an ingredient, launching Godefroy and his servant Jacquouille into the present day. Coming to grips with his situation, he gets the help of his descendant, B?atrice de Montmirail, to try and figure out a way to get back.</p><p>This is a fairly funny film, mixing in slap-stick and some potty humor with the general play on the fish-out-of-water situation. I was never rolling on the floor laughing, but the acting is good and the situations fairly believable. The subtitles seemed to do a good job of keeping the humor, though I don't speak enough French to know for sure. They were a bit fast and furious at times, though I never had to back up to re-read anything.</p><p>This isn't an amazing comedy, but it is still fun. I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone, but it is supposed to be far superior to its English-language remake (with the same two lead actors). For light fare, it was an enjoyable evening.</p>
80411|threekings|DVD at home|2003-08-30|<p>I've already seen this <short=\"threekings\">masterpiece</a>. If you haven't seen it, you should.</p>
80412|chunhyang|DVD at home|2003-08-31|<p>The son of the governor of Namwon, 15-year-old Lee Mongyong, takes a break from his studies to visit a local site of great fame. While there, enjoying lunch with his two servants, he spots Sung Chunhyang, the daughter of a courtesan. So begins their courtship, which quickly results in their secret marriage. But the son of an important aristocrat cannot marry the daughter of a courtesan, and when Mongyong's father is transferred to the capital he must leave his new bride behind with the promise that he'll return when he has passed the exam. But the new governor demands that Chunhyang serve him, and her refusal leads to her being sentenced to death.</p><p>This is a beautiful movie to watch, and although I don't want to watch it again, it would have been nice to see this in a theater. The story itself is fairly solid, since it is perhaps the most famous story in Korean history. A pansori performance wraps and interspaces the story, providing some narrative, and I found it quite enjoyable. If you don't know anything about pansori, though, it would be worthwhile to find a quick essay of explanation before watching the film, as it can be jarring to the uninitiated.</p><p>This movies stands on its own as a romance, and it a must-see for anyone interested in Korean culture or history. Other people will also likely enjoy it, though I was not so enraptured by it that I would recommend it to everyone.</p>
80413|libertyvalance|DVD at home|2003-08-31|<p>Senator Ransom Stoddard returns unexpectedly with his wife to Shinbone. When probed, he reveals that he is there for the funeral of Tom Doniphon. In order to explain their connection, though, he has to tell of their history. As a young attorney, Ransom is robbed by Liberty Valance and his men on the way to Shinbone. Tom recovers him and brings him to town, but also warns him about Liberty and the need for a gun in the territory. Ransom, however, insist that the problems should be resolved with law.</p><p>Of course, the name of this movie was famous enough that I thought it would be a good \"western\" to check out. I also couldn't remember having seen any John Wayne films. Probably I had, but it was too long ago for me to remember. The funny thing is that all the stereotypes of the Duke are pretty much right-on. The accent, the expressions, they are all in the movie. It is hard for it not to come across as comical, but the character, Tom Doniphon, is a fairly nice fit to the movie.</p><p>This is a great story. It is set in a somewhat abstract time and place, though it seems to be pulling from some actual historical situations. Most of the movie is a flashback except for a wrap-around that sets everything up. The situations are interesting in-and-of themselves, and the character development on Ransom Stoddard is quite intriguing. This isn't a Western in the traditional sense, since there are not continuous gunbattles or other such staples of the cowboy movies, but simply that it takes place in a territory in the west that is on the cusp of change.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film. There are certainly some flaws in the picture, but overall it is a great movie.</p>
80414|seabiscuit|AMC Old Pasadena 8 in Pasadena|2003-09-01|<p>Charles Howard starts as a bicycle repairman, but moves to San Francisco and soon falls into selling automobiles at the time when they are starting to become affordable. With his knack for salesmanship, he quickly makes a fortune. Tom Smith had been a cowboy, but with the end of the West and the spread of barbed wire, he finds himself hoboing from town to town when the Depression hits. Red Pollard is the child of a fairly well-off family that falls upon hard times when the Depression starts. Seeing his knack for horses, they turn him over to someone who can nurture his abilities. But, he turns out to be a second-rate jockey. Seabiscuit is a horse that was always second-best, of good breeding but not showing the ability that was expected of him quick enough to make any of his owners happy. But, put all four of these together and you've got the makings of a classic underdog comes out on top story.</p><p>The acting here is all quite good, and the movie really has the visuals down that make everything seem realistic without getting overly sappy or emotional. The story is quite simple, and you know where it is going before it even starts, but this is about storytelling. And in my opinion, that is where this movie works out, it does a good job of storytelling. In the end, there are plenty of gaps, realities of the Depression that are glossed over, not to mention the less-than-happy endings that each of the characters faced in the real world after the last scene of the movie. But, taken by itself, the movie is enjoyable.</p><p>This is probably best described as a date-movie. It lifts up the spirits, presents some intersting and likable characters, and delivers exactly where you expect it to. It isn't for everyone, but there isn't room for many legitimate complaints once you accept it for what it is.</p>
80415|tandem|DVD at home|2003-09-05|<p>Two men meet in a cafe one evening. The one ends up catching a ride with the other until they end their acquaintance near the ocean the next morning. In the meantime, we are treated to the ins-and-outs of their sexual lives, which intertwine in odd ways.</p><p>This is a pink film, as the Japanese call them. A 60-minute excuse to show R-rated porn. The plot is even harder to follow than any of the American porn I remember watching back in Junior High (it's been that long), though I will admit that the sexual scenes, while never showing even a pubic hair, are quite erotic and stimulating.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I came in thinking that this was closer to an art film than simply erotica, and perhaps if I was into the genre it would have been something more than that. But really it was just bits of titillation separated by two guys who are just outright assholes.</p>
80416|hidharma|DVD at home|2003-09-10|<p>Five gangsters are on the run after a mafia battle where they were clearly set up. They are told to hide until their boss calls them to let them know it's OK. But the only place they can figure out to hide that won't make five people conspicuous is a Buddhist temple. Nestled up in the mountains, the gangsters immediately come to blows with the monks, who in some senses are too similar for there not to be conflict.</p><p>The concept here is interesting, but the execution doesn't really pan out. The line that needs to be drawn between realism and farce isn't set properly, so the attitudes of many, particularly the monks, just aren't believable (save the abbot). I was not laughing as much as I expected either, and I don't think it was because of translation or not getting the jokes. Don't get me wrong, the movie was still fun and had that warm-and-fuzzy feeling at the end which you expect it to have.</p><p>There are definitely better Korean comedies, even better gangster comedies. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, though it wasn't bad or unbearable.</p>
80417|themeaningoflife|DVD at home|2003-09-11|<p>The Monty Python troupe examines the meaning of life in a series of vignettes that address each of the stages of life, from birth to live organ transplants to death.</p><p>I've seen this film so many times that I know most of the dialogue by heart. I haven't watched it in years, though, after someone borrowed my copy and never returned it. With the release of a special edition on DVD, there was little doubt I was going to complete my Monty Python collection (I have all three movies and all the episodes, now). Which movie is my favorite changes from time to time, but this one is always stiff competition.</p><p>I don't have much else to say but to tell you to see this film if you haven't already. Monty Python ranks up there at the top with <strong>The Simpsons</strong> as my favorite comedy.</p>
80418|zatouichimonogotari|DVD at home|2003-09-11|<p>Ichi, formerly a blind masseur and now a wandering swordsman, comes into town, visiting a man who had asked him to visit the previous year. That man, however, is a local yakuza boss who is glad to see Ichi, as a rival boss has acquired an Edo samurai who could easily decimate his forces should they come to blows. We know, of course, that the two bosses will come to blows, but as that tension builds, Ichi becomes friends with Hirate, the samurai whose left Edo because of his consumption.</p><p>This is classic samurai flick material, executed well. The story builds up well, drawing you into several characters who you come to care about. The swordplay isn't flashy, but it there when needed. The man playing Ichi also does a wonderful job. He isn't the slim and trim action star one might expect, but a portly fellow whose facial expressions capture the character well.</p><p>If you are at all interested in samurai movies, this is one that must be seen. They ended up making many more films in the franchise, including one that's now circulating the festival circuits starring Beat Takeshi, though I'll not vouch for any of those. An enjoyable film, not the deep mental films of Kurosawa.</p>
80419|limbo|DVD at home|2003-09-13|<p>Donna De Angelo finds herself single again in small Alaskan town, a situation her high-school-aged daughter is used to, though never happy with. Joe Gastineau gives her a ride and helps her move her stuff from her old boyfriend's place, and the two of them find the spark of attraction. Joe is a handy-man, doing odd jobs around town. He'd been a fisherman, like just about everyone else in town at one time, but the drowning deaths of his two crewmates had kept him off the water for a couple decades. His bosses get him to pilot the boat they've acquired, getting him back onto the sea.</p><p>I don't want to go any further into the plot, but this is only the first part of the film. Ultimately, this is a film about relationships for people who've all been burnt by one thing or another in the past and the risks they must take. The focus is on three characters (including Donna's daughter), and you really come to associate with them by the end of the film.</p><p>I'm a huge John Sayles fan and I definitely recommend this film like all the others I have seen. This one has a stronger plot and tighter character focus than his other recent work, and doesn't seem to focus on social issues quite as much as others. The most comparable film of his would be <strong>Passion Fish</strong>, so if you've seen and liked that film, this one will suit your tastes.</p>
80420|onceuponatimeinmexico|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2003-09-13|<p>A CIA agent with a screw loose tracks down \"El\" to put a hit upon General Marquez. Marquez is not only planing a coup, but he is also the man who murdered the mariachi's wife and child. The coup is being orchestrated by drug kingpin Barrillo, whose had his fill of el presidente's constant harassment of him and his element. While El brings in his companions, Sands (the CIA agent) also brings in a retired FBI agent to harass Barrillo.</p><p>This movie is what you expect it to be: some fun special effects and action with a twisted plot that verges on surreal. In the end, I still have to say that I like <short=\"desperado\">Desperado</a> better, but this movie is still loads of fun. There are some things that are just totally unexpected. There aren't enough of Salma or Eva, unfortunately, but there are so many great characters that this can be forgiven.</p><p>I only recommend this film to people who've already seen <short=\"desperado\" title=\"Desperado\">Desperado</a>, and maybe even <short=\"mariachi\">El Mariachi</a>. If you've seen those films, then this is a good follow-up. I think the plot can be followed without the other films as background, but it won't be as much of a ride.</p>
80421|onceuponatimeinamerica|DVD at home|2003-09-17|<p>David 'Noodles' Aaronson is growing up in a Jewish ghetto of New York, born just after the turn of the century. Together with four other boys, they form a gang that is set to dominate the criminal underworld of their area. But then Noodles gets sent off to prison, separating him from his friends and the girl he loves. When he comes out, prohibition has made his gang one of the most successful in town. But what will happen when alcohol is no longer illegal.</p><p>I bought this movie without any real knowledge of it. I'd heard of it, mostly from seeing the poster on someone's wall in college, I'm sure. But it was labeled as Leone's masterpiece (and I think <short=\"thegoodthebadandtheugly\" title=\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\">The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</a> is one of the greatest), and I have rarely been disappointed by De Niro. This did turn out to be a great film, and I have a feeling, after only one viewing, that there are many intricate details that I missed or haven't yet put together. I'm certain it will stand up to repeat viewing. There isn't a lot more I'd want to say, since most of the pleasure of watching the film is hard to convey without giving away fundamental elements.</p><p>I most certainly recommend this film. The director's cut (which is what was screened outside the U.S.) is an excellent movie that any fan of the genre or of Leone will like.</p>
80422|sex|DVD at home|2003-09-18|<p>Singapore-native Grace Quek, in the middle of an undergraduate career at USC, decided to enter the porn industry under the name of Annabel Chong. Experimenting with her sexuality already, she quickly pushes the limit, soon planning to set a world record for a gang bang. She ends up having sex with 251 men in ten hours, bringing it to a stop only because she has been cut and has to stop for health and safety reasons.</p><p>I'm still not sure of what exactly motivated me to see this, but it had caught my attention when it premiered in L.A. I knew going in that it wouldn't really be titillating - one reviewer described it appropriately as sobering. It is a fairly good documentary, though the additional 20-minute feature on the DVD helps put it in perspective a little better. As you piece together Grace's life, it is depressing to see her naivete and illusions about certain things. On the bright side, the extra footage from the release of the movie in theaters has Grace looking much better than in the movie, and I read that she is out of the porn industry now and working in the computer industry.</p><p>Although the documentary is interesting, I cannot really recommend it to everyone. There are certainly people who would find it interesting, primarily those that might enjoy the insight into the porn industry or the psychological development of a young woman who is clearly disturbed.</p>
80423|whenwewerekings|DVD at home|2003-09-18|<p>With the announcement of a title fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Zaire, the director got a camera and followed the events. Putting everything together over two decades later, he adds in interviews with a few people who were also in Zaire at the time, as well as Spike Lee. We see how the events unfold as well as a surface issues surrounding the politics of the event. Highlights of the fight are also included, with analysis.</p><p>I've been wanting to see this film for a long time, but have just kept putting it off for whatever reason. It is definitely a good documentary, and it deserved to win the Oscar that it got. For me, one of the most impressive things is to see the effect that Ali had upon people all over the world. When he de-planes in Zaire, there are huge crowds. When Foreman lands, it is a much smaller group. The effect of a black man standing up for what he believes in in the most powerful country in the world effected an incredible number of people.</p><p>This is definitely worth watching. Even if you aren't a fan of boxing (which I honestly don't know much about), there is good history here that people should be aware of.</p>
80424|investigationofacitizen|Nuart Theatre|2003-09-28|<p>On the day of his promotion to the head of the political division, the chief of the homicide division murders his mistress. He leaves clues around that point at him, and then calls in the murder. At the department, he plays dumb, but along the way he drops more clues and confesses to many outside the department. Will the department ever investigate a citizen above suspicion?</p><p>This film is loaded with irony and comes with a fairly meaty political message. I was laughing quite a lot once everything was set up. I'm still unable to put my finger on any final conclusions about the film, unclear on what the film was trying to say exactly, but condemnations of the state and its pretensions of force were abundant. I'd definitely consider watching more of this director's films.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to other people, for even if you aren't particularly political the humor is rather universal. It is making the art houses now, and perhaps will be on DVD shortly thereafter.</p>
80425|bubbahotep|Nuart Theatre|2003-10-03|<p>Elvis switched with an impersonator during the height of his career, tired of all the fame and glory, but then the impersonator up and died. After breaking his hip, he's been stuck in an old-folks home in eastern Texas. The only other person who believes that he is Elvis is an elderly black man who claims to be JFK. And then they stumble upon the presence of a 3000-year-old mummy who is sucking the souls of the home's residents.</p><p>Even without Bruce Campbell at the opening night, I would have enjoyed this film. Having a man who is just naturally funny there to boot just made it that much cooler. This film touches a range of humor, from potty to political and social, and doesn't overdo any of them. The delivery is excellent as well, and I have incredible respect for Ossie Davis after his performance as JFK. In the end, for a redemptive Elvis movie, this was quite satisfying.</p><p>Many people, of course, are not going to appreciate this film (and thus its limited release). But, if you are a fan of Campbell's work, this is definitely worth checking out.</p>
80426|headofstate|DVD at home|2003-10-07|<p>When the candidates for President and Vice-President die in accidents just eight weeks before the election, the party realizes that it doesn't have a chance to win the election. But, that doesn't mean they cannot put forward a candidate that will help them win some serious political capital for the next election. Enter D.C. alderman Mays Gilliam, a small-time politician who actually cares about his constituents. It doesn't hurt that he's black. The party quickly puts him on the campaign trail, handing him all his speeches. But it gets to be too much for Mays, and he decides to start running the campaign his own way.</p><p>This movie looked very tempting when I saw the trailers, but it also looked like it had the potential to be lame. In the end, I was very happy I'd sat down to watch it. There are some jokes that fall flat, but overall I liked the humor and all the various pokes at the political establishment. The film doesn't make any fundamental mistakes, although it doesn't stray from some expectations. This will definitely be a good movie to watch in the weeks before any election, but particularly a presidential one.</p><p>I recommend this film to anyone, even people who may not like Chris Rock that much. It is, of course, still laden with Rock's style of humor (and I know many people who just don't like him), but if that isn't a stumbling block for you, definitely pick this one up.</p>
80427|tailorofpanama|DVD at home|2003-10-07|<p>Andy Osnard, an MI-6 agent whose just been involved in a scandal, is transferred to Panama. The canal has been handed over to the local government, and there is a greater interest in what is going on there. Andy scouts out a local expatriate, Harry Pendel, who works as a tailor. Through his job and his wife, Harry has a number of important contacts. But when Andy starts putting on the pressure to come up with information, Harry starts making things up. In order to keep it interesting and worthwhile for Andy and his superiors, the storytelling quickly escalates.</p><p>This is a truly delightful film. It is based upon a book by Le Carre, which in turn is based upon the Graham Greene novel, <strong>Our Man in Havana</strong>, which I read recently. The absurdity of the situation is only slightly unrealistic and provides excellent political commentary on our societies and their secret services. In light of recent revelations about Iraq intelligence, it should be clear that the desire of those higher up to hear certain things can cause even clearly doubtful information to be treated as otherwise. On top of all this, Brosnan and Rush both give excellent performances.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film. It mixes so many elements that give you something to think about while entertaining that it shouldn't be missed.</p>
80428|themack|DVD at home|2003-10-08|<p>Goldie returns from a stint in the state pen with the hopes of making it big, only Goldie hopes to make it big as a pimp. As far as pimps go, Goldie is fairly respectable, staying away from the drug trade and the like. And then a crime boss comes in hoping to muscle Goldie into selling his drugs. He has the backing of two corrupt cops to help him out.</p><p>This movie is a classic and has influenced any number of black and blaxploitation films since. The acting is fairly solid, and to top everything off, there are actual pimps in the film and advising during production. The movie obviously glorifies the pimp trade, but it still inserts a few moments into the film that lay out the realities of life for people in Oakland in the Seventies.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to anyone. There is great dialogue that you've probably heard repeat elsewhere if you didn't know it came from this movie. I cannot weigh in on the merits of most blaxploitation, but this isn't that kind of film, and it is enjoyable in its own right - not because of some camp value we derive upon reflection.</p>
80429|lianna|DVD at home|2003-10-11|<p>Lianna's husband had cheated on her before, but she thought they were through it. When she catches him at it again, she has to take a hard look at her life. Upon inspection, she finds that she is a lesbian and begins having an affair with a professor for a night class she has been taking. She struggles not to be ashamed of her situation, but her husband has her in a bind - he knows that if they go to court she'll lose the kids as soon as he reveals her sexual orientation. On top of this, her new sexuality causes confusion in the friendships and relationships she already has.</p><p>This is a good film that is firmly set in the time period it was shot. The dilemmas and situations are very much early-Eighties. This is a time period before lesbians have much of a subculture of their own and before it had become somewhat acceptable in society at large. And to top it all off, the movie does not feel exploitative or fringe. The problems that Lianna faces are problems that most people her age face, only twisted by social conditions.</p><p>Although one of Sayles' more obscure films (by my standards, at least), it is of the same level of quality as his later work. I recommend this film to anyone.</p>
80430|killbillvol1|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2003-10-13|<p>Black Mamba falls in love and decides to retire from her life as an elite assassin. Unfortunately, her boss Bill doesn't like the idea. At the wedding, everyone is killed except for the bride. When she wakes up from her coma several years later, her pregnancy is over and it is time to seek some revenge. Venita Green is the first to fall. Then it is off to Japan to secure a weapon which will make her battle with O-Ren Ishii one to remember.</p><p>Visually, this movie is amazing. There are just so many things that are being done here that are a pleasure to watch unfold on screen. The homages to the old films are rich and plentiful as well. The one drawback. This film is just not on par with Tarantino's previous films when it comes to dialogue. Whereas his other films left lines and quotes in your head, this movie left me with not one single line I could remember the next day.</p><p>I recommend the film, though I also think that this isn't Tarantino's best work. Given the long hiatus, one would have expected a little more from him. Guess he was busy taking my place in line at the Chinese movie festivals (I'm not bitter).</p>
80431|girlfight|DVD at home|2003-10-16|<p>I liked this <short=\"girlfight\" title=\"Girlfight Movie Review\">movie</a> the first time I saw it, and recently decided to buy it. My oldest sister was in town and wanted to see it, a proposition to which I was not opposed. If it isn't clear from that action, I recommend the film.</p>
80432|mysticriver|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2003-10-17|<p>Jimmy, Dave, and Sean were friends when they were growing up in East Buckingham, a neighborhood in Boston, until Dave was kidnapped and disappeared for four days. After that, they drifted apart. The murder of Jimmy's daughter, however, brings them all together again in unfortunate ways. Sean is the detective investigating the murder. Dave is a suspect, his situation aggravated by his coming home covered in blood the night of the murder. Jimmy was once the head of a small-time band of crooks, having served time and still holding the loyalty of his crew.</p><p>I'd read the book this movie was based upon, so I was curious to see how they put it on film. Some things were changed, most notably the ending. In the book, for example, Sean doesn't appear to have any wife. This was added to make the ending happier, since the novel doesn't exactly end on a happy note. I also thought that the interpretations of Jimmy and Dave's wives was different in a negative way. The movie was still well done, holding the main plot of the book (though scouring out most of the class elements). I enjoyed it, but felt that without the book first, I would have probably not seen it.</p><p>I don't really recommend the film. It isn't horrible, but if you are interested in dark murder mysteries, read the book instead.</p>
80433|thequietamerican|DVD at home|2003-10-19|<p>Thomas Fowler works for the Times as their overseas correspondent in Viet Nam in the early 1950s. He is married back in England, but his true love is her in Viet Nam, Phuong. Alden Pyle comes into the picture, posing as an official with a U.S. medical assistance program. The quiet American quickly makes moves to take Phuong away from Thomas, aided by her sister who is primarily interested in status and family heritage.</p><p>This is a great movie that explores the time period just before Dien Bien Phu and the period where U.S. interests are starting to exceed those of the French. The movie uses the love story to tell a political story, ultimately tying the two together inseparably. It also pulls few punches in showing the nature of U.S. involvement in Viet Nam even at this early stage.</p><p>I highly recommend this film. It is very well done, the acting is excellent (I had not seen Fraser in a serious role before), and the cinematography is an eyefull. It is rare to see a blend of stories like this.</p>
80434|killingofachinesebookie|DVD at home|2003-11-12|<p>Cosmo, a Korean War vet, owns a strip club in the Valley. He is passionate about his business, keeping a close tab on everything that goes on. He loses $23,000 gambling, and signs an agreement with the illegal establishment to get their money to them. But his money is tied up in his business. When he cannot come up with it quick enough, the gangsters set Cosmo up to kill a local Chinese bookie.</p><p>This is a slow-moving picture that will leave many wondering what happened by the end of it. It is a character portrayal, but it is sometimes quite hard to really be interested in the characters. I found myself watching it,  but not clear on why. The acting was good, it was just that the story and the characters didn't interest me in the end.</p><p>I don't recommend this film. I've heard good things about Cassavetes as a director and this was my unfortunate first taste. I'll give him another try, but I'm not so hopeful at this point.</p>
80435|schoolofrock|Edwards Valencia Grand Palace Stadium|2003-11-15|<p>Dewey Finn has dreams of being a rock star, and in many ways he is already living the life... sleeping in his friend's den. When the friend's girlfriend gives the ultimatum of coming up with rent or getting out, he has to search for a real job. To boot, his band has just dumped him in hopes of preparing to win the big battle of the bands. Posing as his roommate, he takes a substitute teaching job at an elite prep school. Finding that his class has music talent, he sets about forming them into a band with hopes of winning the battle.</p><p>This movie is just tons of fun. If you are the least bit of a fan of classic rock, then you will certainly enjoy the music and musical references throughout. On top of everything, it seems like everyone is enjoying themselves, the kids included. The direction of the film isn't at all hard to see, but it is the journey there that makes it worthwhile. I was laughing most of the way.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film as a light-hearted comedy. It's even accessible to young people, not delving too much into immature humor but still keeping the humor open to all.</p>
80436|triplettes|Laemmle Royal Theater|2003-11-27|<p>Ms. Souza is raising her grandson after his parents passed away. Only, her grandson doesn't seem to be happy with anything. And then it hits her and she gets him started into cycling. Soon we flash forward to his competing in the Tour de France, where he is kidnapped and taken away to Belleville. Ms. Souza is hot on their trail though. She falls in with the Triplettes, living and working with them while she searches for her grandson.</p><p>The animation on this is pretty interesting. It didn't seem cutting edge to me, the way that some Japanese animation does, but it did feel very fresh. The mix of old styles in with new make is fascinating, and perhaps that appeal to my taste for things old helped make a positive impression on me. The music was great, and there actually isn't too much dialogue in the film at all.</p><p>This is a fun story that I'd recommend to anyone whose interest this movie has caught. When asked, I had to say that this is also a good film for kids, especially in light of the themes. The grandmother in this movie rocks!</p>
80437|centrestage|DVD at home|2003-11-30|<p>Ruan Ling-Yu rose as a diva in Shanghai film in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In just a few years, she was the most sought-after starlet. She falters in and out of a couple relationships, and struggles to expand her capacity as an actress. When a controversial film leads to a trial, she says her good-byes in her own way and ends her life at the age of 25.</p><p>This film mixes actual footage of Ruan Ling-Yu in films, interviews between the director and Maggie Chueng as well as people who knew Ruan, and dramatizations of the events of Ruan's life. Not expecting this format, it was a bit jarring at first. But, in the end, I thought it did a good job of portraying the woman and her life. I won't say I fully understood everything that happened, but I did come to appreciate her effect upon Chinese cinema.</p><p>This film isn't for everyone. Maggie Chueng is a great actress, and it was her that drew me to the film originally. I imagine that will be the same reason for most other people who do not know about Ruan Ling-Yu already. I would recommend the movie to those people though.</p>
80438|secretary|DVD at home|2003-12-06|<p>Lee Holloway gets out of a mental hospital and returns home to live with her parents. She starts searching for a job, and ends up landing a job as the  secretary of a lawyer, E. Edward Grey. Lee's inclination to harm herself soon merge with power issues that the lawyer has, leading the two of them into a bizarre sado-masochistic relationship. When he brings it to an abrupt end by firing her, she decides that she needs him and will do what it takes to win him over.</p><p>Up to a point near the end of the film, this was quite interesting. The characters and situations drew me in and made for an enjoyable experience. And then suddenly it feels like the writer just couldn't think of anything else to say, couldn't figure out a way to end the movie. The last segment just breaks all character consistency and leaves the viewer wondering what in the world is going on. If I were still lonely, the only worthwhile part in the last ten minutes would be the full-frontal nudity of Maggie Gyllenhaal (who I think is one of the best looking actresses in Hollywood right now).</p><p>I don't recommend this film to anyone. It is good up to a point and then just disappoints. I don't see any reason for anyone else to sit through it and be let down the same way I was.</p>
80439|8mile|DVD at home|2003-12-07|<p>Rabbit is a young worker in Detroit, doing a day job at a stamping plant and hanging out with his friends at night. He dreams of making it big as a rapper, and several of his friends have faith in him. But there are many obstacles to overcome besides his own inertia, from him mother's boyfriend situation to his own relationship troubles. When he gets put on stage, he chokes, making it even harder for him to show his white face among the black crowds that he dwells in.</p><p>I liked this film. I haven't really listed to Eminem's music that much to know more than a couple songs, but I liked how it came across in this film. There is also a good deal of Detroit in the film, from the conditions under which people live and work to the situations they have to deal with on a regular basis. And then the ending doesn't just dump an unnecessarily happy situation on the viewer, but instead leaves things open enough to still feel realistic.</p><p>I recommend this film, and have talked to quite a number of people who don't care for rap but also enjoyed the film. There are certainly failings to the film, but it is still worth the watch.</p>
80440|zeroeffect|DVD at home|2003-12-10|<p>Daryl Zero is the world's best private investigator and Steve Arlo is his front man and runner. Arlo is necessary because Zero just doesn't seem to do very well with direct interaction with the client. They land a job with a rich man named Stark who has lost his keys and is being blackmailed for it. But when Zero starts to investigate the situation, there seems to be a lot more going on that Stark has let on.</p><p>The movie is slow to start, especially when you come in not knowing what to expect, as I did. Another thing that threw me for a loop was Stiller playing the straight man. This is still a comedy, but it isn't the kind of roll-on-the-floor-laughing comedy I somewhat expected. I wasn't disappointed, however, as the story that develops is intricate and interesting in and of itself.</p><p>I recommend this film. The development is fun and the ending uplifting, even if somewhat vague. Near the end you may still be wondering how things are going to end.</p>
80441|bigfish|AMC 14 Theaters, Century City|2003-12-19|<p>Edward Bloom always told his son Will tall tales about the life he led. At a young age, the stories were fun. But as Will grew up, they became annoying and intrusive, such that when Edward is dying, Will is plagued by the question of who Ed Bloom really is. As he recounts his father's life through the tales he told, we get a glimpse of what must have really happened, but by the end it is the son who has to reflect upon his own life.</p><p>This is a beautiful and funny film that has a lot of fun playing with the edges between reality and tall-tale. I read numerous complaints about the film by critics, and I have to say that many of them are unfounded. There is originality here, particularly in the visuals in which Tim Burton is just a master. The story isn't any real surprise, but it is a journey that feels good all along the route. And in the end, the message is one that certainly hasn't worn itself out.</p><p>I recommend this film, particularly to Burton fans. There's even some social commentary spliced into this thing that make it all-around fun.</p>
80442|snowfallingoncedars|DVD at home|2003-12-25|<p>Ishmael and Hatsue are childhood sweethearts until Hatsue and her family are taken off to the concentration camps after the entry of the U.S. into World War II. In 1949, a fisherman is found dead and the accusation of Hatsue's husband, Kazuo, brings the racist history of the small northwestern town back to the surface. Ishmael's father had stood alone against the relocation of the town's Japanese, and now Ishmael has to overcome his own feelings about being jilted to save a man's life.</p><p>Watching this film, one immediate regret comes to mind, and that is not having went to see this in a theater. The cinematography is clearly amazing and beautiful, even on my piddly TV screen. The story is also interesting, developing in ways I hadn't necessarily expected. There is no real solid resolution to what happened in the town, though there is personal resolution, and that makes the film a little bit more appealing than average. The twist on the love aspect is also refreshing.</p><p>I recommend this film to just about anyone. The acting is good and the story isn't one you'll find somewhere else (well, except maybe the book, but I didn't read that).</p>
80443|thegoodthebadandtheugly|DVD at home|2003-12-27|<p>While the Civil War encroaches upon the area, three outlaws try to stay out of harms way and make a small fortune while they are at it. Two of our outlaws work together intermittently, depending on how much they still need each other. In their own ways, each finds out a part of the puzzle as to the location of some stolen gold worth $200,000. Getting to the gold without getting killed is a much more difficult task than might be expected, though.</p><p>This is one of the greatest movies of all times. The music is classic. The direction is incredible. The cinematography is a pleasure to the eye. And the characters and their respective actors just suck you in. There's a pleasant mix of reality and humor sprinkled in as well, that you don't always get with Westerns. It is hard in the end to decide whether Eastwood or Wallach's character is the most appealing.</p><p>I think I've already said enough to indicate my recommendation. EVERYONE should see this film.</p>
80444|returnoftheking|Edwards Cinemas at Irvine Spectrum|2003-12-27|<p>As Frodo and Sam continue to make their way into the depths of Mordor, with Gollum's impending betrayal clearly on the horizon, the rest of the party rushes to Minis Tirith, trying to gather forces along the way. The final, decisive battle between good and evil, humans and Sauron's forces, is upon them. Aragorn must not only wield the sword that marks him king, he must be victorious or all that is good will be swept from the world.</p><p>The thing that really struck me about this movie was how good the acting is across the board. Perhaps it is simply because I didn't know more than a couple of the actors before seeing these movies, but every does a stellar job. This film is must better composed that the second film, in my opinion, making it easier to watch and more enjoyable in the end. The main drawback to the film is simply that it feels like it is about to end several times, and then continues on. It wraps things up nicely, though, and the changes from the books were not grating at all.</p><p>I obviously recommend this film, but I don't think I need to. If you haven't seen the first two films, then there is no point in watching this one. If you have already seen the first two, then you are going to see this one anyway. Now I just have to wait for the extended edition next year.</p>
80445|peterpan|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2004-01-03|<p>After a mishap involving the dog and her father's boss, Wendy is put on the course of growing up to become a refined, middle-class woman. But Wendy and her younger brothers don't really like this idea. Peter has been eavesdropping in on the stories young Wendy has to tell, but get's his shadow caught. When he comes back to retrieve it, he meets Wendy for the first time and ends up inviting her to his world, Never Land. There she encounters the wonders and horrors that that world has to provide, all the while learning what it means to stay forever young.</p><p>I never read, or had read to me, the book this is based upon. I'd only seen the Disney interpretation, which I cannot say that I remember all that well at this point. In any case, this movie was getting good reviews, and the slightly dark nature of it made it sound like it would be interesting. It was. The special effects are used to good ends, and the acting of the different children involved is quite good. I also enjoyed the fact, although I didn't note it until the credits rolled, that Captain Hook and Wendy's father were played by the same actor. He did a really impressive job of separating the two.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to just about anyone. It is a great tale of growing up that doesn't bash you over the head with its messages, although they are clear enough for children to grasp.</p>
80446|battleofalgiers|Landmark Westside Pavilion Cinemas|2004-01-10|<p>Ali La Pointe is your typical colonial city-dweller, having been in and out of jobs and jails many times in his young life. After witnessing the execution of a fellow Algerian by the French authorities, he decides to align himself with the FLN, who is fighting for independence. As the battle with the French heats up, the military is brought in to suppress the insurgency. The military knows that less-than-noble tactics are required to win the battle if France is determined to retain control of the colony.</p><p>This is one of the greatest films ever made, plain and simple. The political significance of everything in this film seems to have been thought out. While it has been called pro-Algerian, I find it very fair and even-handed, showing the French for who they are while showing the FLN for what it is as well. If you place a value upon one side over the other, it is more your own prejudice, as neither is without "sin". The film exposes the brutal repression that is necessarily a part of the nature of imperialist domination over another country. We also see the anti-democratic tendencies of the FLN as well, setting itself up as leader and working to keep people from acting when they cannot control it. To top off everything, there is only one professional actor in the entire film.</p><p>Everyone should see this film. That's all there really is to say. It is that much more relevant today as the U.S. carries out the same kinds of activities in Iraq to oppress the people there. Likewise, the factions we see in Iraq are the same limited nascent dictatorships that the FLN was for Algeria.</p>
80447|arabiannights|Video at friend's house|2004-01-17|<p>When the Sultan, as a result of the personal betrayal of his wife and brother decides to start marrying a bride a day, only to have them killed in the morning, the Vizer's daughter, Scheherezade, stands in to be the first bride with the hope that her storytelling can enrapture the Sultan and lead him to end his insane plan. She pulls the stories from those around her, and over many nights tells him tales such as Ali Baba and the 40 thieves, Alladin, Bak Bak, and more.</p><p>I found this movie quite good, and was really impressed with the fact that it was made for TV. Some things were a little silly and others predicatable, but overall I have to consider this a good interpretation of the tales. The use of a wide ethnic mix (although certainly determined in part by the paucity of actors of Arabian descent) was also interesting (some of it, admittedly, is also in the original). I liked the costume work and the interplay of stories. I'm actually looking for a used copy of the movie now, so that I can use some stills from the movie when I start running an Arabian-influence role-playing campaign in the future.</p><p>I'd recommend this as lighthearted viewing. The intended audience is broad, ranging from very young children to adult, and in the end the overall message is a somewhat moral tale to learn from.</p>
80448|drzhivago|DVD at home|2004-01-24|<p>When his mother dies, young Yuri Zhivago leaves the countryside to live with friends of the family in Moscow. About 1913, he is a medical student about to finish his studies and marry his adopted sister. This is when he encounters Lara, a plaything of an influential politician, and is impressed by her. When the war starts and Zhivago can no longer avoid service, he enters as a medic and it so happens that Lara becomes his nurse - she entered the army to find her husband. With the revolution and the end of the war, Zhivago returns to Moscow to his wife and child. His impropriety and reputation as a self-obsessed poet make things difficult for him in the city, and with help from his long-lost (and never met) brother (a member of the secret police), he flees to his hometown. In the nearby village, of course, is Lara, with whom he quickly starts up an affair. But then Zhivago is taken by partisans to act as their medic in their fight against the Whites. Zhivago eventually deserts and returns to his hometown to find that his wife and child have fled to Paris. He shacks up with Lara for a while, but his desertion and her status as the wife of a now-dead government officer lead to their eventual separation. Zhivago dies on the streets of Moscow, longing for Lara, while Lara lives out her life in the east with the politician who'd raped her earlier in the film - bearing a child of Zhivago's that his brother seeks out many years later.</p><p>Oops, did I just give away the whole movie. Good. I find movies like this hard to take. The cinematography was amazing. The music was wonderful. But that is pretty much where it ends. The main character is supposed to be in love with two women, when in fact he is only in love with one person - himself. There are few redeeming qualities to him, and they disappear over time. An additional factor that irritate me to no end was the historical anachronisms and inaccuracies. There were things happening and said in 1913, that don't make any sense until some time in 1917 (particularly anything the movie mentions about Bolsheviks at that time). It continues with people acting in 1917 like it is 1927, and so forth. The there is the script. There are many lines which are clearly only there to fuel the anti-communist propaganda of Cold War America, as they are completely gratuitous otherwise. The portrayal of the Russian people of the time is dishonest at best, purely unnatural in order to fuel a sense of indignation not at Zhivago's crass self-obsession but with the difficulty of his situation (which wasn't really all that difficult). It brings to mind a section of the novel <strong>Candide</strong> where the most piteous person is the daughter of the Pope, because she has fallen the farthest. In <strong>Candide</strong>, the author was clearly aware of his satire... here it is clear that they are not.</p><p>Well, if it isn't already obvious, I did not like this movie. There is no reason for anyone to ever watch it.</p>
80449|brotherfromanotherplanet|DVD at home|2004-01-25|<p>After his spaceship crashes in the water near the Statue of Liberty, a mute alien must figure out how to make his way. He has the ability to fix things and an incredible sense of empathy that allows him to overcome his inability to speak. After a run-in with the police, he finds himself in a bar in Harlen, where the locals quickly evaluate him and eventually help him out.</p><p>The movie is a bit rough and jarring at times, confusing for brief stretches before things are cleared up a bit. But otherwise, this was a very enjoyable film. There are many humorous scenes and many parts of the film that poke and prod and the question of race and acceptance. Most fascinating for me was the ability of people to just talk and talk despite the fact that the alien is mute. Many of them never even realize he is mute. Sometimes the script and lines feel stretched, but many times it does in fact feel natural.</p><p>I'd recommend this film, particularly to Sayles fans. It isn't his finest work, but still an amusing and thought-provoking film.</p>
80450|capturingthefriedmans|DVD at friend's house|2004-01-31|<p>In the late 1980s, the father and one of the sons of the Friedman family are arrested for sodomy and child pornography charges. The incident destroys the middle-class Jewish family in New York. After a few years in prison, the father commits suicide. The son serves thirteen years, but is currently fighting to prove his innocence of the charges. The documentary reviews the case as it played out in the 1980s through footage shot by the family at the time, as well as interviewing important people in the case today.</p><p>This is not a light subject to take on, and the directors do a fairly good job at it. My main complaints with the documentary are really that there is material among the extras on the DVD that should have been included in the film itself, throwing additional light on the case. I'd also say that the director doesn't do as good a job as he might to reveal his own biases, but I really have no suggestions on how this could have been much better.</p><p>I don't really recommend the film. Not because it isn't well-constructed, but because the subject matter is one that just isn't worth watching for most people. The analysis of American hysteria about sex-crimes and pedophilia is interesting, but I wouldn't watch it again. I cannot say I gained all that much from watching it either, except details about a case that isn't nearly as important as many others that are out there. My girlfriend was also frustrated by the lack of a conclusion... but this is a case that isn't over.</p>
80451|closeencounters|DVD at girlfriend's house|2004-02-01|<p>Roy Neary is sent out to repair power lines when large scale power outages hit the community of Muncie, Indiana. While out, he and several other people witness unidentified flying objects, pursuing them to the best of their ability. Those who saw the objects are then plagued by visions of a mesa. When the government tries to hush things up, they show pictures of the mesa out west, claiming that the area is shut down because of a deadly chemical spill. But those who witnessed the aliens cannot resist the draw.</p><p>I didn't really know what to expect going into this film. Obviously, there are aliens involved, but I didn't know in what context. It turns out, this is a conspiracy film. I think I would have to watch it again to get the full thrust of the film, since many things seemed disconnected and confusing to me on this first watching. The ending was pretty cool and the special effects were rather impressive for the year it was made. I still had to laugh at the alien's hand signals, though.</p><p>Maybe it was my unfocused attention or any number of other things, but I wasn't bowled over by this film. It was fun, and I enjoyed Dreyfuss' performance. If you are into aliens in a subdued, conspiracy sort of way (not a laser-firing, action way) check out this film.</p>
80452|mysassygirl|DVD at girlfriend's house|2004-02-02|<p>Gyun-Woo is an engineering student who gets thrust into the life of a young woman when she is drunk one night on the train. Forced to take responsibility for her, he ends up in a series of embarrassing situations that also get him in more trouble. But as he keeps running into her, his affection for her grows - despite her highly abusive attitude toward him.</p><p>This was the number one comedy in South Korea the year it came out, and when you watch it it will be clear why. There are many hilarious scenes and situations, much of it very light-hearted, and then you have the romanced put on top of it all. The characters are likable, despite all their obvious flaws, and you really come to feel for the guy by the end. As a romantic comedy, the ending is done quite well, with a twist that isn't utterly predictable.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film. I'd been trying to get hold of it for quite a long time, and finally my girlfriend was able to borrow it from a neighbor. I'm glad I saw it, and I'm looking forward to seeing more films from this same director.</p>
80453|greatescape|DVD at home|2004-02-14|<p>In World War II, the Germans were faced with the problem of officers who continually tried to escape from their prisoner-of-war camps. Their solution was to collect them all together at a camp that took advantage of all the tricks and lessons they had learned over the years. Unfortunately, this also put all the best escape artists together in one place. The men quickly set about figuring out how to escape from this camp, with the double goal of escaping with so many men that the Germans have to to use an excessive number of men just to be able to recapture them all.</p><p>For me, the most amazing thing about this film is the ability to raise the tension level from a very early point and keep it high throughout the whole film. In addition, many different character are thrown at you who each have their own personality. The events of the film are also supposed to be based on a real prison break, though some people were changed and events compressed to accommodate the needs of film. This adds an element of suspense and pulls out the possibility of a Hollywood ending where everyone is happy and perfect in the end, and that makes the ending of the film that much stronger.</p><p>I recommend this film not just for fans of WW2-genre films, but for just about anyone who can get behind the action/suspense that is done well here. There is some acting to complain about, but for the most part, this is an enjoyable film that I'll be able to watch again in the future.</p>
80454|murderbydeath|DVD at home|2004-02-16|<p>Lionel Twain assembles the world's five greatest detectives at his home for a weekend of murder and mystery. Things are fishy from the beginning, as the blind butler shows them each to their room and prepares them for dinner. Twain's proposal is to match wits with all of them, hoping to outsmart them at their own game. As the designated hour approaches, they try to be crafty and avoid becoming victims.</p><p>This is fairly funny movie that is much better if you know the different detectives being made fun of. There are the two Agatha Christie detectives, a Sam Spade imitation, a Charlie Chan immitation, and another one that I cannot put my finger on right now. Some of it gets absurd at times, and I found myself rolling my eyes more than once. It was decidedly lighthearted, though.</p><p>Although a funny film, I wouldn't go out and recommend it to anyone who doesn't already have an itch to watch it. Neil Simon, the writer, is good, but I suppose that if I knew more about the film before I put it in my queue, I would have just held off.</p>
80455|futureboyconan|DVD at home|2004-02-25|<p>War leads to environmental destruction, and the Earth is left with only a few survivors. Conan, living with his "grandfather" on an otherwise deserted island, is happy until one day a young girl washes ashore. Hot on her trail are forces from Industralia who want to capture her in order to locate her grandfather - a scientist who knows how to capture solar energy. They want to use Lala to force the old man to help them power a super weapon what will enable them to take control of the world that remains. Together with friends they make along the way, Conan and Lala hope to develop a new world based on peace and cooperation.</p><p>I actually watched this over a period of months, watching an episode or two every now and then. It runs about 750 minutes total, so it isn't exactly something you sit down and watch straight through. The story and message aren't all that complex, playing upon environmental and human concerns that stick with Miyazaki up through today. It is children who have the potential to make a difference, and it is they who seem most clearly (if perhaps because of their innocence) what should be done to make the world a better place. This is a great message, because it has in fact been the youth (including people into their twenties) who have really made the political and social changes of human history. On top of all this, there are some bizarre and quirky things that just pop up all the time throughout this series. Conan has more strength in just one of his toes than any dozen actual human beings. Lala's semi-mystical powers are also interesting at times, through not nearly as prominent.</p><p>I liked this series a lot. If you are a fan of Miyazaki, it is definitely worth watching. Apparently, for many east Asians in their early thirties, this also has nostalgia value. The copy I watched (from my girlfriend) was released out of Hong Kong, but I've also seen Korean and Japanese versions available.</p>
80456|failan|DVD at Korean Education Center|2004-02-26|<p>Kang-Jae is a maturing hood, just out of a short jail stint for having sold pornography. He isn't getting respect from his juniors, and his boss isn't treating all that great either. The gang's territory is also being muscled in on. In a bout of anger and retaliation, the boss kills a rival gang member. Kang-Jae is about to take the fall for the crime, when he learns that his wife, a woman he'd married for money and never even met, has died.</p><p>This movie isn't uplifting per se, but does actually have a nice element to it. I thought it was well done. There are some camera angles that seem a bit odd at first, but they don't detract from the film itself. Cecilia is unimpressive, as might be expected, with her overly pure presentation, but we fortunately don't see much of her in the film. This isn't a romance between the two, but a story about a man who reevaluates his life. There are also elements which don't come as a surprise, but I didn't mind this, since it just made the situation more realistic for me (because to do otherwise would have been absurd in the way that Hollywood movies typically are).</p><p>I'd recommend the film to most people, as long as you aren't expecting it to put you in a good mood. There was something about the character that I felt I could relate to, perhaps, which is after all the goal of any storyteller.</p>
80457|basicinstinct|DVD at girlfriend's house|2004-02-28|<p>Nick Curran, SFPD Homicide detective, is brought in to investigate the murder of a retired rock and roll star. All signs point to his lover, Catherine Tramell, a wealthy author with her own mysterious past. As they begin to investigate further, there appear to be a number of unexplained deaths in Catherine's past, leading Curran to suspect her more - even while others in the department say it is absurd. But Catherine isn't a passive actor in the least, but knows quite a bit about Curran and his past, supposedly writing her new murder mystery about him.</p><p>There are several elements early on in this film that just blow the realism. People acting in ways that just don't make sense, in particular police officers who do not follow standard and expected procedures. Douglas does a good job, but I found it hard to evaluate Stone's performance. She comes across as trying to be seductive and sexy, but that underneath she really isn't. This does fit into the character she is playing, but there is something about the performance that makes it feel like she isn't acting, but that she herself is just playing at being that way.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. It wasn't so horrible that I shut if off before it was finished, but I also don't see it as having any quality that makes it watchable outside of recent release (where it had some controversy that was fairly unimpressive, in my opinion). The thing that stood out most for me about this movie was how it was really the product of an earlier time (80s), when it was still acceptable to show an high amount of nudity in a semi-serious film... it just doesn't happen anymore.</p>
80458|myarchitect|Cecchi Gori Fine Arts Theatre|2004-03-07|<p>Nathaniel Kahn learned that his father had a wife and daughter elsewhere when he read the obituary at the age of 11. It turned out that this reknowned architect had three children, all from different women. As Nathaniel tackles his own questions about his father's past, he explores the artist who many architects consider one of the greatest of the twentieth century.</p><p>This documentary does a good job of mixing humor, emotion, and facts. Interviews with significant architects such as Pei and Ghery drive home the importance of Louis Kahn as an architect, while interviews with people like Bacon show what kind of novel ideas Kahn had and allow for some humor that certainly wasn't intentional on Bacon's part. For me, the movie also got me to think about what architecture should and could be. I liked some of Kahn's style, but also saw its shortcomings as well.</p><p>I'd recommend this film for anyone who is interested in architecture or in documentaries in general. Nathaniel's personal questions and search aren't what make the film interesting, but they add a personal element that don't detract from things. For me, Kahn's personal life brings up questions of responsibility and maturity and the pursuit of art which I think are tied to this society in general and which I cannot answer clearly for myself at this point.</p>
80459|firefly|DVD at home|2004-03-08|<p>Set five hundred years in the future, the crew of the firefly class ship Serenity live on the edge of legality. The captain, Malcolm Reynolds, and Zoe had been members of the resistance against the Alliance several years before. They take on board several passengers, including a Shepherd (religious man) and a couple refugees from the Alliance. As well, a Companion uses the ship as her base of operations. Over the course of 15 episodes, we learn more about each character and the worlds in which they reside.</p><p>There are a number of unexpected twists and turns throughout the series, and a number of conventions that are blatantly broken to positive effect. I heard about this show because a fellow at the comic book shop I visit won the Emmy for the special effects for the show. I slowly watched the episodes over  several months and was impressed by nearly all of them. Certainly, certain episodes have slow spots or strain to make sense, but for the most part the story and characters are solid and endearing. A movie is supposed to be forthcoming, and I'll certainly be catching that if it does. And, yeah, the special effects are quite impressive for a television show.</p><p>I recommend watching this series if you get a chance. I don't watch TV, but this is one of those rare shows that make the medium interesting. I won't rule out buying the DVD set for myself in the future, should I wish to see the show again.</p>
80460|thenavigators|DVD at home|2004-03-12|<p>As British Rail gets privatized, the lives of the men who work for the railroad get tossed around like so much flotsam. At first, there is the illusion that the depot they worked for will remain as a company, but many people are sent their separate ways or to the placement agency rather quickly. Ownership changes hands a few times before everyone begins looking at the agency, where pay appears to be higher. But this is all deceptive, as benefits and safety are cut out from underneath the rail workers in the name of privatization.</p><p>Having read a number of articles about the horrors of rail privatization in Britain, this movie helps to consolidate many of those facts into a fictional rendering. Everything in the movie feels real, though, and the conditions faced by the workers here aren't all that different from those faced by workers throughout the industrialized world, whether being "privatized" or not. I only have two complaints about the movie. First, there are many characters that are hard to keep track of at the beginning of the film, keeping me confused for a while. Second, there were no subtitles recorded on the DVD, so when I couldn't catch something through an accent (and I'm better than average at picking up accents) there was no recourse to the captioning. Otherwise, although not uplifting, this was a great film. </p><p>I certainly recommend this film, particularly to those who are interested in the material. It is great to see the underside of the corporate welfare programs that are privatization. In the end, we still need to do something about it, to fight against it, but it is useful to understand it so as to fight it better.</p>
80461|returnofthesecaucus7|DVD at home|2004-03-13|<p>A group of friends who all met during the late Sixties meet up once a year to catch up. As with every year, there is is always a little drama. This time one of the couples has just separated after years of marriage. Others are progressing on with their lives and tackling the idea of turning 30 as the Eighties approach.</p><p>This is one for Sayles fans. It was his first, and although this shows, it also reveals quite a bit of talent and plenty of heart. The characters are interesting and personal, and I didn't have any trouble believing most of them. Not a lot happens as far as plot movement or action, the focus instead being on character development.</p><p>This isn't a must-see film, but true fans of Sayles will probably want to catch it anyway, just to see the early footsteps of not only a great writer and director, but also of several of the actors involved.</p>
80462|classic|Korean Education Center|2004-03-25|<p>Ji-Hae begins reading through the love letters of her mother's first love at the same time that she is writing the e-mail love letters for her friend. Like her mother's first love, she is writing the letters for someone she has come to love herself, although there is a good friend in the triangle to make life more difficult. As she reads through the diaries and letters of the previous generation, the parallels just get stronger and stronger.</p><p>This is the most heavy-handed melodrama I've seen in a long time, but then I don't tend to go in for melodrama to begin with. The movie had great potential to be a fine romance, and was liberally sprinkled with comedy to keep it lighthearted while alternating with the frequent tears of the main actress (who plays both the mother and the daughter). There are parts of the film, especially in the first half, that are solid. But then things really fall apart. Situations that the audience has already grasped are repeated out loud, ruining the pleasure of discovery. Some things are just too glaringly obvious, and the ending is just way overdone.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Except for the lame special effect for the fireflies, the film is visually clean and professional, but the story just doesn't hold up over two hours. Editing out about 20 minutes and leaving a little mystery may have saved the film, but at this point it is too late.</p>
80463|kazenotaninonaushika|DVD at home|2004-03-27|<p>In a world where humanity has done such extensive environmental damage to the planet that most of the world in uninhabitable, young princess Nausica&#228; struggles to find a way to make the world healthy for all human beings. Two warring states encroach on her small village, leaving in a crash the seed to a weapon that could destroy the forests and the large Ohmu insects which protect it. As our heroine discovers the secrets of the forests and its insects, she has to act quickly to prevent the two factions from destroying everything.</p><p>This is one of Miyazaki's first feature length films. The sci-fi and visuals are already amazing and worth watching alone. The theme, characters, and situations will be familiar to anyone who has already seen any of Miyazaki's other environmentally oriented films. But everything is put together well and I found not trouble sitting through a movie whose ending I was practically certain of from an early stage.</p><p>Of the Miyazaki films I've seen, I would consider this one of the best (together with <short="mononoke" title="Mononoke Hime">Mononoke Hime</a> and <strong>Heisei Tanuki Gassen Pompoko</strong>), and on that level would recommend it as one of the first to see if you are just getting into Miyazaki. Word is that the DVD will be out here in the U.S. here in a few months.</p>
80464|eternalsunshine|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2004-03-31|<p>After Joel's relationship with Clementine goes sour, he tries to make contact with her but she doesn't even seem to recognize him. A friend reveals that Clementine has had her memory of Joel erased, and after confronting the doctor who performs the procedure, decides to have her erased from his memory as well. But when he has second thoughts while the procedure is underway, there is little he can do about it, being incapacitated and unable to communicate with anyone - trapped in his own dream world as it dissipates.</p><p>I usually shy away from anything with Carrey in it, but this one was getting really good reviews. With an invite to go watch it, I wasn't sure what to expect. In the end, the film was very well done. It merged time and dream back and forth in a seemless manner that made it quite believable. There wasn't anything particularly moving about Carrey's performance, but the story, characters, and situations kept me interested. Ample doses of humor were spread about, and in the end it was the human lesson that I appreciated.</p><p>I'd recommend this film. It isn't must-see, but the treatment of the question of memory versus the person is intriguing and unique among the movies I've seen.</p>
80465|hellboy|Pacific Beach Cities 16|2004-04-04|<p>During a raid against the NAZIs in the 1940s, the American group foils a plan to open a gate to Hell, but not before a small spawn makes it through. Jump to the present day, and Hellboy is an agent for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, a secret government agency that fights against paranormal disturbances. When a god of resurrection is unleashed in a New York museum, the team has to keep it from getting loose, but every time they kill it, two more are reborn. As the clash with the forces gathered by Rasputin accelerate, the team is off to a remote location in Russia to face their final battle.</p><p>There's a lot to like about this film, but there is also a lot that is just mediocre. The special effects are well done, particularly the way that Hellboy is done. The fights are often fun and satisfying, and much of the humor is where I'd expect it to be. But there just doesn't seem to be enough about the characters to make them truly interesting for the person who hasn't read the comic books. Rasputin is particularly boring and inactive. I think I expected more humor, too. Oh, and product placement is blatant - with lighting focused on the product being plugged to make sure the audience doesn't miss a thing.</p><p>I don't think I'd recommend anyone see this film. It was fun, mind you, but just didn't meet my expectations (and my expectations were simply for a fun rendering of a comic book). With the movie, many of the old comic books are more available now - go grab some of those.</p>
80466|girlnextdoor|Pacific Beach Cities 16|2004-04-17|<p>Matthew is a senior, looking to go to Georgetown if he can only get a scholarship. But he also wants something else, something more interesting to remember about his high school years than being an overachiever with no social life to speak of. And then an incredibly hot woman starts housesitting next door. When they hit it off, it will change Matthew's life forever, and not simply because she has worked in the porn industry.</p><p>This movie is quite funny. Even though the ultimate outcome is in little doubt, the roundabout way it twists its way there is mostly refreshing. There was only one point in the movie (the last bank scene) that grated on me. The scene was necessary for setting up the rest of the movie, but was a little too unrealistic for my tastes. Everything else, however, is just pure and simple (well, not so "pure") fun. Oh, yeah, and I could never get tired of Elisha Cuthbert - even with my general distaste for blondes.</p><p>This isn't a deep movie, but I'd recommend it to anyone who can enjoy a high school movie with a good sensibility. For light fare, it definitely pleases the palate.</p>
80467|springsummer|Landmark Westside Pavilion Cinemas|2004-04-25|<p>At a monastery floating in a lake in some remote Korean valley, two monks take care of the grounds. One is an old man and the other a child, who the old monk has taken in as an orphan. As the years progress, the old monk instructs his charge in life, from his youthful torturing of small animals to his sexual desires to worse. With each season, life progresses in the world outside, but the temple is constant.</p><p>I enjoyed the symbolism that pervades this film. In each season there is an animal (though, admittedly, I'm not sure of the symbolism of a couple of them). On top of it, the scenery and cinematography are amazingly gorgeous. My main complaints about the film are a couple things that were unnecessary, in my opinion. Near the end, when we get flashbacks to the boy torturing the animals, it is completely unnecessary. The allusion was already obvious. The departure of the mother at the end was also excessive, though not all that surprising.</p><p>This is a beautiful film that's I'd recommend to anyone who can enjoy a good art film. Just make sure you watch it on a screen that does the visuals justice, because you don't want them diminished in the least.</p>
80468|easyrider|DVD at home|2004-05-06|<p>After a drug deal, Wyatt and Billy leave Los Angeles for New Orleans on their choppers. Along the way, they see the sights of America, meet a couple  travelers to bring along for the ride, and run into more than their fair share of trouble. Most of the trouble comes from the way that backwards Americans react to their appearance, always long before they have a chance to even say or do anything. Will making to New Orleans and Mardi Gras mean that the two have found freedom?</p><p>I could quickly see how this movie would be beautiful to watch on a big screen. The landscape shots of the backcountry of American are amazing. Unfortunately, for me at least, that was where the appeal of this movie ended. I understood the message, and was quite surprised by the ending, but it just didn't grab me. While the movie was trying to show the merits of the hippy lifestyle, I was more impressed by the quick glances at poor blacks along the road in Louisiana.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film. It isn't horrible, but it just seems like a movie whose time has passed. Perhaps a few retro types would enjoy it more.</p>
80469|azumi|DVD at home|2004-05-22|<p>Following the bloody battle of Sekigahara, a man is assigned the task of assembling a group of assassins. Their mission is to assassinate any lord who seeks war that will disturb the peace which the country is desperate for. Azumi and nine other boys are raised from a young age to carry out this mission. Now that they are age, following a final test, they must set out into the world at large to complete their mission. The forces weighed against them may not be such pushovers, though.</p><p>There are a lot of dead bodies in this film, with the heroes wading through throngs of fighters to reach their goals. Much of the fighting is stylized, though not in an unpleasant way. There are a number of sweet camera techniques that impressed me. In particular, one scene with a vertically rotating shot and another that lets us seen an arrow deflected into the head of an enemy. The downside of this film is the plot, which is quite weak, and the characters, which are overly immature. The personal issues that the young protagonists have are mostly shallow and abstract, not fitting well up against the supposed seriousness of their training and mission. This disconnect left the movie with a dissatisfying tinge. I still had fun, but not nearly as much as I would have hoped.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film. Kitamura's <short=\"versus\"  title=\"Versus\">Versus</a> is much more consistent, if more than a bit gorey. The director is working on the next (and last?) <a href=\"http://www.godzilla.co.jp/\" title=\"Godzilla Website\">Godzilla</a> film, which has my hopes up. I think he has certain talents that just need development or assistance.</p>
80470|tasogaresamurai|Laemmle Playhouse 7 in Pasadena|2004-05-23|<p>Iguchi Seibei, called Tasogare (or Twilight) by fellow samurai, is a low-level bureaucrat in a northeastern han in 1865 Japan. When his wife dies, he has to struggle to take care of his two daughters, ten and five, and a mother who clearly has Alzheimers. The divorce of his childhood friend, Tomoe, brings her back into his life. He ends up in a duel with her ex-husband, and in return she begins helping to care for the children. Tension builds after the lord of the han dies, throwing succession into question at a time when tensions are already rising on the national level. Even a samurai as low as Iguchi cannot escape his duties to the clan.</p><p>This movie is amazingly beautiful to watch, with excellent acting all around. My friend found the story's conflict slow to develop, but I personally thought there was a building tension throughout the film. The love story is moving in the way that only Japanese love stories can be. In many ways, the film feels like a slice of life in the final days of Tokugawa Japan with incredible attention to details. Unlike many samurai (or chambara) flicks, this movie really seems to have an eye to historical accuracy while still providing a dose of action. The fight scenes, while short and sparse, convey a level of tension that is amazing. They did seem a bit longer than I might expect, but they still felt quite realistic. In the end, the movie bottles up an incredible amount of symbolism as well, exploring the fall (twilight) of the samurai class as well as the emergence of a modern Japan.</p><p>I would certainly recommend this film. I was happy I got to see it on a big screen, instead of waiting to see it on DVD. This isn't so classic that I'll be likely to buy the film, but it is good film-making.</p>
80471|menaceiisociety|TV at sister's house|2004-05-29|<p>Kaydee is about to finish high school in South Central L.A. His grandparents who have raised him are proud. But life in this neighborhood isn't all roses. After his friend kills the owners of a liquor store, things start to go downhill. Egos start to class and murdered friends have to be revenged. Meanwhile, Kaydee is growing closer to the former girlfriend of a man who'd been something of a big brother to him. She wants to get out and for Kaydee to come with her.</p><p>This film is not light by any stretch of the imagination, so should not be watched unless one's in the mood for something that might weigh you down for a while. The film is excellent. I thought the acting was quite good and the plot moved along in a realistic stream, even as it cascades.</p><p>I'd recommend this film, with the warnings I've already stated. It does a good job of capturing the effects environment can have on someone even when they are trying to be good people. That's something I find an unsympathetic ear for quite often, no matter how much it fits to reality.</p>
80472|therundown|Video at sister's house|2004-05-29|<p>Beck is a man trained to violence but who really just wants to open up his own restaurant. Locked into an obligation to recover items for a man, he secures the promise of a final job if he travels to Brazil to bring back the man's son, Travis. Travis has been trying to track down a solid gold artifact, meanwhile stepping on the toes of the local mining boss, a real slave-driver. Throw some guerrillas into the mix, and bringing Travis back to the U.S. may not be as easy as it seems.</p><p>I liked this movie a lot. It isn't anything more than it pretends to be, but it is tons of fun at what it does best. The action is over-the-top and there is plenty of humor to round things off. On a positive note, there are even several stunts and action sequences that are genuinely creative and new, something that seems to be harder to come by lately.</p><p>I can only recommend this movie to fans of The Rock. Other people aren't going to like it, but this is a distinction that sorts itself out rather easily. Given nothing better to do, I'd watch this again.</p>
80473|themedallion|DVD at aunt's house|2004-05-30|<p>Cop Eddie Yang is tracking down an organization that kidnaps a young boy. They want the boy because he is the only one who can join the two halves of a medallion that can unleash incredible powers. Eddie dies in the line of duty, but the boy uses the power of the medallion to bring him back to life with the aforementioned powers. Can Eddie and his partners stop the bad guys before they are able to take advantage of the powers of the medallion as well?</p><p>Hollywood has done a lot of harm to Jackie Chan, as far as I'm concerned. I hadn't seen this movie in the theater for precisely that reason. His last few Hollywood movies have been a bit trying. This one isn't much of an exception. The plot is quite simplistic and lame, and not pulled off in a way that could salvage it. The characters aren't all that appealing either. The films saving grace are some really amazing action sequences throughout the film. But even here, I have to say that the special-effects laden final fight scene was disappointing.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, really. Die-hard Jackie Chan fans will have already seen it, but this just isn't worth it for a Chan fix.</p>
80474|johnnyenglish|DVD at aunt's house|2004-06-01|<p>With all of Britain's secret agents killed at the funeral of the top agent, when the Crown Jewels are stolen, Johnny English is the only one to go looking for them. He suspect Pascal Sauvage, the man who had recently been in charge of a cleaning and restoration of these same jewels. Johnny's bungling, though, causes his commanders to swear him away from Sauvage. These leaves Johnny and his assistant alone to track down the culprit... with the help of an attractive agent who turns out to be on the same side.</p><p>I've never really been into Rowan Atkinson's humor, and this movie doesn't really diverge from the other humor of his that I've seen. There are certainly some funny moments, but overall the film ends up being a bit trying. Not so bad that I couldn't sit through it, but certainly it doesn't inspire me to see any of his other films. I couldn't recommend that anyone else does, either.</p>
80475|secondhandlions|DVD at friend's house|2004-06-02|<p>Walter is left with his two uncles while his mom runs off, supposedly to attend classes. This isn't the first time she's done this, but this time he's being left with two uncles who are reported to be loaded with cash. Mom, of course, hopes that Walter can uncover it. The two uncles, however, are on the curmudgeon side of things and don't really appreciate visitors. The longer Walter stays, the more he becomes curious about his uncles and their pasts.</p><p>I liked this film a lot. Caine and Duvall are great, playing characters that I found incredibly likable. The film ends up being touching and funny, playing with a past the way that <short=\"bigfish\" title=\"Big Fish\">Big Fish</a> did, leaving the viewer questioning what was real and what was fake, but not disappointing that the line is never clearly drawn in the sand. I guess I'm just a pushover for eccentric old men, being a fan of Waldorf and Statler from a young age.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to most people. It isn't deep or insightful, just a nice story about growing up filtered through some great personalities.</p>
80476|mybigfatgreekwedding|DVD at aunt's house|2004-06-02|<p>Toula Portokalos is a 30-year-old Greek-American. Not being the most outgoing or attractive of women, she is still single. Her parents imagine that some day a Greek man will come along and marry her, providing the family with plenty of children and Toula with plenty of time to cook. But then Toula meets Ian, and as they become more involved, the question is how will her family handle her attraction to a non-Greek. When it comes time for the wedding, the involvement of Toula's massive family will contrast sharply with Ian's American nuclear family.</p><p>There were many funny parts to this film, and I can certainly understand one person's comments to me when the film came out that immigrants will really appreciate it. The love story is touching. I also enjoyed the fact that the main character isn't really attractive in a physical, Hollywood way. I didn't really get much out of the film, though. It wasn't painful, but I couldn't see myself drawn to watch it again or look for other films from the same crew.</p><p>I don't really recommend this film. Perhaps it will be fun for children of immigrants, especially peasant immigrants who hold to the old large-family traditions. The romance itself isn't worth the watch in my opinion.</p>
80477|downtoearth|DVD at aunt's house|2004-06-03|<p>Lance aspires to be a stand-up comedian, hoping to land a big spot on the Apollo's closing night. Then one night, while biking home, he gets hit by a bus. Problem is, he wasn't supposed to die yet. Heaven cannot give him his old body back, so they offer him a new one. He ends up opting for Charles Wellington, III. This gives him access to Sontee, the woman he'd been looking at when he got hit by the bus. Problem is, Wellington is a rich white guy, and Lance's brand of Black humor doesn't play so well coming from his lips. Against all odds, though, Lance wins over the heart of his love interest.</p><p>Apparently this is a remake of another movie that I haven't seen. It was obviously twisted to fit the mind of Chris Rock. The movie as a whole works, as corn-ball as some of the elements are. What is great is the fact that Rock gets to lay down some excellent humor along the way, saying things that we all know is true but that just don't get aired in American media if it can at all help it.</p><p>This isn't a great movie, but I'd recommend it to Chris Rock fans. The scene where Wellington rips into the board of the hospital is almost worth it alone. The rest of the movie ends up just being a vehicle for some good jokes along the way.</p>
80478|mybosssdaughter|DVD at aunt's house|2004-06-03|<p>Tom has the hots for the boss's daughter, Lisa. Afraid for his job at the slightest whim from the old man, he still cannot refuse an offer from Lisa to come over. He just doesn't realize that she's asking him to housesit while she goes to a party with her boyfriend. With a list of strict rules, Tom is not alone for long in the house, as calamity upon calamity visit him through the night.</p><p>I don't have much to say about this film. I hadn't heard of it before I watched it, and don't plan to set foot near it ever again. It wasn't so absolutely painful to watch, it is was just completely lackluster. The humor is clearly aimed a people with a different sense of humor from mine. It is sad that today's youth has developed a sense of humor which likes this kind of movie, but then I guess that's why we don't have many intelligent comedies today. Thanks a lot, Hollywood.</p>
80479|meettheparents|Video at sister's house|2004-06-04|<p>Greg Focker is madly in love with his girlfriend and ready to propose when he finds out that he needs to meet her parents first. So, as they head off for her sister's wedding, he gets his opportunity to make an impression upon her father. Problem is, her father is an ex-CIA agent who is suspicious of everyone, particularly those dating his daughter. Add to this the fact that everything just seems to go against Greg as the weekend progresses. By the end of the weekend, he'll be lucky if she'll even talk to him, let alone marry him.</p><p>I tend to have mixed feelings about Ben Stiller, but with the encouragement of friends and relatives decided to watch this film at last. It is fairly funny, even with the exaggerations that just don't make sense at times. I can see the things that frustrate other people when they said they disliked the film. The film does cross the line from absurd but believable to just beyond the pale of reality, although it doesn't seem to be aware of this in a way that would make it more acceptable.</p><p>Although funny, I wouldn't watch this movie again, I think. I don't recommend against it, but I also don't see any reason to see it if you haven't already. A sequel is set to come out soon. If other people pull me to see the film, I'll watch it, but I won't go out of my way to watch it.</p>
80480|monster|DVD at sister's house|2004-06-04|<p>Aileen Wuornos is a road-side prostitute in Florida. Life is hard and hardly worthwhile when one night she meets Selby. Inspired by a newly discovered love, Aileen tries to make something more out of her life in an effort to provide for Selby. But there are no doors open to an ex-prostitute trying to make something of herself. When she resorts to hooking again, she manages to come out on top of a life-and-death situation. Seeing the possibilities and overcoming her hesitations, when things get hard again she kills several more johns before the authorities finally pay attention to the murders and track her down.</p><p>I hadn't really heard about Aileen until this movie and the documentary started to attract attention. The movie is well done and I have to admit that Theron did an excellent job of portraying the character. The overall story is tragic, of course, since we already know that Aileen has been executed as long as you've paid any attention to the news. It felt real, that the people and situations were as one might expect and that motivations were in place.</p><p>I still cannot say I'd recommend this film. If you have some interest in the case, then it is worth watching. The film is more sobering or depressing than anything else, though. Not something to watch unless you're willing to handle the sour mood you'll have afterward.</p>
80481|mybabysdaddy|DVD at sister's house|2004-06-04|<p>Lonnie, G, and Dominic have been together since birth. Living with an uncle, they all manage to get their girlfriends pregnant at the same time, too. Struggling with keeping it real in the face of parental responsibilities of all sorts, they each have to make life decisions about what they want to do with themselves in light of having a child.</p><p>There are certainly funny moments in this film, and the 8-year-old rapper is certainly cute, but overall this movie is disappointing. There's quite a lot of humor that's just in bad taste. I didn't at any point feel any kind of compassion towards the characters. Through it all, we can see the ending coming a mile away and it just isn't worth the ride.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Even if you are a deadbeat parent, this isn't where you're going to learn to turn over a new leaf.</p>
80482|dm2|DVD at home|2004-06-07|<p>I hadn't watched this <short=\"dm2\" title=\"Drunken Master II Review\">movie</a> in a while and thought my youngest bother should see it. Still a classic.</p>
80483|mywifeisagangster2|DVD at home|2004-06-08|<p>In a huge gang fight atop a skyscraper, our heroine falls to almost certain death. But she instead only suffers amnesia and minor injuries. Two years later, her gang still doesn't know where their leader has disappeared off to, but a noodle shop owner is sure glad to have her helping out. He also would love to get to know her on a more intimate level, but she resists this even in her sleep. When a rival gang comes in to scare out the area shopkeepers so that construction can start on a shopping mall, the opportunity will arise for our heroine to remember her past.</p><p>The <short=\"mywifeisagangster\" title=\"My Wife Is A Gangster\">first movie</a> was hilarious and very well done. In particular I was impressed with Shin Eun-Kyung's performance, doing an excellent job of capturing the attitudes and emotions of the character and eliciting plenty of laughs with it. Here, the character just doesn't work. Some of the same situations are presented, but they just don't pan out. On top of this, much of the fight choreography is disappointing. I'd heard that she'd been injured while filming, so perhaps this is partly at fault, but the script and flow just lack the life of the first film.</p><p>I don't recommend this film. Catch the first one, by all means, but watching this sequel will just disappoint.</p>

But the last camel to give birth has a lot of problems birthing a white camel. After the camel is born, the mother rejects it, leeding to worries for the family. They try many things to get the mother to accept its child before it starves to death, finally sending their sons off to Aimak to fetch a musician.</p><p>Although slow and simple, this documentary was still interesting. I have to admit that I got to cheat though, since I had a Mongolian sitting next to me giving me running commentary. This helped point out one of the failings of the film, which was the subtitles - many things aren't translated. For fans of documentaries, however, it is still a good watch. The people are clearly aware of the presence of the camera nearly all the time, but we still get an insightful view of life on the edges of civilization. I have to admit surprise at the ending.</p><p>Take note of the fact that National Geographic had a hand in this film. If you're the kind of person who enjoys reading or watching things they sponsor, then you will almost certainly like this movie. Few people have had anything bad to say about the film, and I count myself among them.</p>
80485|oasis|Laemmle Playhouse 7 in Pasadena|2004-06-19|<p>Hong Jong-Du, a man of 29 years who clearly isn't all there, has just got out of prison. Unable to find his family, who have moves, it takes the police picking him up to finally locate them. He then searches out the family of the man he was sent to prison for killing in an automobile accident. That family is in the process of moving, but leaving behind a physically disabled Han Gong-Ju. Returning later, Hong tries to introduce himself and then attempts to rape the woman. But then she calls him up unexpectedly. Soon they develop a relationship that no one else understands.</p><p>This is a hard movie to describe to other people, since the basis sounds so offensive and absurd. The movie, however, works quite well and doesn't seem at all unrealistic. Ultimately, it is about two people who no one else want to treat as human beings or adults. There are numerous scenes that pound in this fact. Sadly enough, this is also apparently pretty much how handicapped people are treated in South Korea. Over the course of the movie you get to understand who these two people are and what it is they want out of life, even though everyone else seems to be against it. I will warn you that this movie doesn't not have a happy ending, so be prepared to cry if you are susceptible to such things when watching movies. The one complaint that my friend had was with Moon So-Ri's acting when we see her imagination. I didn't find a problem with it myself, since it is a fantasy, but then I don't speak Korean.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to anyone. I thought is was well done and certainly a movie I would consider watching again at some point down the line, though definitely not when I'm feeling a little depressed already.</p>
80486|vibrator|Laemmle Playhouse 7 in Pasadena|2004-06-23|<p>Rei is browsing through the convenience store looking to buy liquor and snacks. In comes Takatoshi, who catches her eye and then taps her buttocks as he passes. Soon she is in his truck, and the two of them are traveling together as he makes his deliveries throughout eastern Japan. Neither seem to have much purpose in life, but are looking for something.</p><p>This is no uplifting movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it really manages to speak on many different levels. The acting is top-notch, and every last detail seems to be dripping with meaning or symbolism. The situation manages to catch the hopelessness of a large group of people in modern Japan, not to mention the industrialized world as a whole. The different levels of narration allow use to get at more problems and feelings that the main character has. There was much made of the director's experience in the porn industry, but I saw nothing the least bit tasteless in the film's presentation.</p><p>I cannot really recommend this film. Not because it isn't thought-provoking or interesting, but because it really takes a certain type of person or a particular mood to want to watch it. I can understand why some people considered this to be the best Japanese movie of 2003. Maybe I cannot recommend it mostly because it only spoke to my loneliness and sadness, but didn't seem to teach me anything about myself.</p>
80487|thespookwhosatbythedoor|Directors Guild of America|2004-06-24|<p>Under pressure to integrate, the CIA decides to go through the motions of hiring a Black agent, fairly sure that none will make it through the process. Dan Freeman surprises them all, landing the only spot. But then he spends five years making photocopies, working reception, and giving tours of the building. Frustrated, Freeman quits and returns to Chicago. Using the training and knowledge gained in the CIA, he forms an guerrilla army of Black men willing to take on the U.S. government.</p><p>This movie played for a couple days in L.A. before it was pulled, never to be seen again until now. Most of the people involved in the film never worked in film again. Why. Because this film is not only funny, but subversive. Sadly, most of the humor comes from the reality of the situation, the racism of the system in which we live which has not changed all that much in the past thirty years. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and liked a lot of what it had to say. The real failing of the film is the lack of a political outlook. Amidst the arming to fight the U.S., there is no political program laid out. Although reality would never allow the situation to advance as far as it does in the film without these questions coming to the fore, the film can ignore them.</p><p>I recommend this film to everyone. It has been put on DVD with the screenwriter adding a commentary track. I'm going to try to get hold of it, just so I can listen to that, since he was quite funny and interesting in person that night after the film.</p>
80488|negroeswithguns|Directors Guild of America|2004-06-25|<p>Returning to his hometown of Monroe, North Carolina after an aborted stint in the military, Robert Williams soon becomes the local head of the NAACP. He helps organize protests over the public pool, where Blacks are not allowed despite the taxes they pay. Williams also advocates armed self-defense, and it is this that gets the local white population hot under the collar. Klan rallies come to town, but Williams and the community stand firm, ready to fight back when their neighborhoods are invaded. With mounting pressure, Williams and his family leave the area but then face trumped-up charges of kidnapping. They, in turn, flee the country for eight years, returning in 1969 in a different climate.</p><p>This is an excellent documentary that I hope becomes more widely available. Right now it is only at festivals, from what I can tell, but hopefully it makes it to theaters or at least DVD in the future. The film does an excellent job of showing the situation and its development. Robert Williams is definitely an important figure in U.S. history that has been mostly ignored to this point. I'm happy so see that his book (of the same title) is back in publication. It was great to hear the broadcasts of his radio program, which showed how much this man had been able to accomplish.</p><p>This is a film everyone should see. They should show this in schools. In addition, anyone who can get their hands on the book should give it a read. Highly recommended.</p>
80489|aroundtheworldin80days|Alhambra Renaissance|2004-06-26|<p>After stealing back a jade buddha from the Bank of London, Lau Xing stumbles into a job as a valet for Phileas Fogg, an inventor and laughing-stock of the Royal Academy of Science. On a bet, pushed along by Lau Xing, Phileas Fogg sets off on a journey to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days. As they set off, Lau Xing is pursued by the minions of General Fang, who is working with British officials to take over China (or Lau Xing's village, in particular). Lord Kelvin also has his own people pursuing the group, hoping to prevent them from completing the journey.</p><p>I found this movie to be a lot of fun. I wasn't concerned with how close the movie stuck to the original (which it clearly didn't do very well). Instead, there is plenty of good, light-hearted humor and fun action scenes. On top of this, there is a healthy dose of cameo appearances from various celebrities that provide unexpected flare throughout. The plot is simple, and there is not way this is going to be memorable, but for a Jackie Chan fan, it is an improvement over his other recent American films.</p><p>If you are a fan of Jackie Chan, then you should see the film. The movie also has a lot of appeal for kids, its primary target audience. Other people should avoid it, since they just aren't going to appreciate the fanciful tale.</p>
80490|fahrenheit911|Laemmle Playhouse 7 in Pasadena|2004-06-27|<p>After a contested election where George W. Bush lost the popular vote, his presidency appears to be on the lackluster path of a lame-duck. But then the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 provides the impetus for his entourage to push there policies on the American population. The documentary looks at the connections and movements of the president and his friends and advisors. It also looks at the reality behind the wars as well as the way the average American sees and deals with the changes to their life.</p><p>This movie is very well done. I was sceptical of how it would turn out, since I know that I disagree with Michael Moore's politics - and the critics presented it as simply advocating that. This film doesn't have the unsettling moments that plague <short=\"bowlingforcolumbine\" title=\"Bowling for Columbine\">Bowling for Columbine</a>. Instead, the real gems of the film are the personal glimpses into how Americans and soldiers and Iraqi's deal with our current situation. There are so many good scenes, and so much material to provoke after-movie discussion. I also felt that the movie leaves things open-ended, leaving room for viewers to draw the correct conclusions, not just Moore's point of view. It shows the way in which the government uses fear to manipulate people. It shows the way that corporations and personal ties influence public policy. The film's failings include a soft hand toward the Democratic Party. They are presented merely as weak, instead of the willing accomplices they are. Not looking back before Bush's presidency, the movie ignores the role Clinton played in setting up and preparing for this war. Although not presenting anything new to those of us who have been opposed to U.S. policy from the get-go, the medium of a movie that is bound to be seen throughout the country is a great opportunity. Now if only it would lead to the population throwing off both yokes, the two factions of business's political party.</p><p>I recommend that everyone see this film. The only people who aren't going to like it are those who have their heads stuck complete up their asses. The real war is the one against the American population, and if this movie allows a few more people to see that and then decide to do something about it, great.</p>
80491|spiderman2|ArcLight Hollywood|2004-07-01|<p>Nearly two years after the death of his uncle, Peter Parker is still struggling to keep his life together as a student, as Spider-Man, and as a love interest for Mary Jane. Running himself ragged and letting Mary Jane slip through his grasp into an engagement with another man, his super powers start to disappear as well. Maybe the best thing for Peter to do is retire as a super hero so that he can focus on his life and education. But then Dr. Otto Octavius's fusion experiment goes wrong and fuses four mechanical arms to his body, creating Doctor Octopus. Bent on recreating his experiment on a larger scale, only one man may be able to stop him.</p><p>Many people are saying this movie is better than the <short=\"spiderman\" title=\"Spider-Man\">first</a>, and for good reason. I think they did a good job of keeping everything together, moving the story along with an interesting plot, and even giving something to the comic fans. I personally loved Bruce Campbell's cameo. The special effects are mostly well done, though there are a few times when the CGI is a little too obvious. And when the dialogue descends into corn and morality, it is done well, so that it doesn't break the atmosphere of the film at all.</p><p>I recommend this film to all. It doesn't cover any introspective territory to qualify it as great film, but it is plenty of fun. Of courses, if you haven't bothered to see the first one, then you should already know where you stand on this film.</p>
80492|controlroom|Laemmle Town Center Theatre in Encino|2004-07-03|<p>With the U.S. military's tight control over the media, when Al Jazeera is willing to show a side of the war hidden from U.S. audiences, officials get angry. Rumsfeld, in particular, spewed forth voluminous amounts of venom in an attempt to discredit the station, while at the same time carrying out the very actions he was accusing the Arab network of. This documentary takes a look at the network, the people behind it, and the coverage they are giving to the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq. At the same time, we get to see the experiences of U.S. and British media as well when dealing with CentCom, the U.S. military's filtering machine.</p><p>This documentary does a good job of getting behind the scenes. The two main people who she interviews at Al Jazeera do an excellent job of conveying the troubles the network has faced and the feelings of the people behind the news. Although the focus is on Al Jazeera, it is quite interesting to also see how frustrated the reporters from the other networks get at the games the U.S. military plays. For example, the day of the invasion of Baghdad, the press conference instead focuses on Jessica Lynch, a non-story compared to the lead. We also get a glimpse at what the military is willing to do to control the media, particularly the Arabic media. Al Jazeera is not above reproach, and we can see in some of what they portray their own audience pandering. But, they also do an excellent job of showing how and why they show the clips that will never make it onto U.S. mainstream media. When the U.S. military makes claims that have no support, they seem to be the first (and sometimes only) people to call them on it. The main thing missing from the movie is the position of the network in their own country.</p><p>I definitely recommend this documentary to those really interested in how the media works. It is also a great look behind the scenes of a scripted war that sometimes doesn't follow the script of the head writers. If the movie is available in your area, catch it.</p>
80493|sympathyformrvengeance|DVD at home|2004-07-11|<p>Ryu is deaf and dumb, and his sister will die soon if she doesn't get a  kidney transplant. Ryu decides to donate his, but then it turns out he is not the right blood type to be a doner for her. With little time, Ryu find a group of people who will take his kidney and money in exchange for finding a proper doner. They come through, but then Ryu needs the money that he gave the kidney merchants in order to pay for the operation. His girlfriend suggests that he kidnap and ransom his former boss' daughter. But, they instead decide to kidnap his boss' neighbor, Park's, daughter. Everything spirals downhill from there, and it won't be clear if Ryu or Park are supposed to be the \"good guy.\"</p><p>First off, you'll have to suspend some disbelief to buy some of the premises of this film. Different scenes are set up for the flow of the story, but not to maintain realism. Once you accept this, things are a mixture of funny, sad, and just plain demented. The best word I can give to this film is \"twisted.. One important note for those of you who do not read Korean, the subtitles are inadequate. Everything eventually comes out in the dialogue, but there are numerous scenes where the audience is expected to be able to read something on screen, and there were no subtitles to fill us in. I wish I'd grabbed one of my Korean friends to watch the film with me.</p><p>Although interesting, I cannot recommend the film to everyone. If you can appreciate a truly demented film where you know from an early stage that things are just going to get worse and worse for everyone involved, then sit back and enjoy. You really have to have a taste for this. There's also a bit of gore, though not too graphic.</p>
80494|shurayukihime|DVD at home|2004-07-17|<p>In the years after the beginning of the Meiji period in Japan, a woman's husband is killed by four people so that they can profit off of a village. Sent to jail for killing one of them, she gets pregnant so that her child may grow up to take revenge. Twenty years later, Yuki has gotten all the training she needs and is tracking down the remaining criminals.</p><p>I actually not that well versed in the chambara genre, so I cannot compare this to other movies. I was quite surprised at the graphic nature of some scenes. Not that I was offended, simply that it was the kind of thing I expect more in a 90s film. The plot itself is doused with improbability, but is quite fun none-the-less. The main character is certainly likable, and there are a few twists to the plot that I wasn't looking out for. I can easily see why this movie was a strong influence on Tarantino.</p><p>This is a specialist's film. If you are interested in old Japanese movies or in the foundations of other <short=\"killbillvol1\" title=\"Kill Bill Volume 1\">films</a>, you'll definitely want to check it out anyway. If you just like a good, old-fashion revenge flick, it will also please.</p>
80495|theylive|DVD at home|2004-07-19|<p>Nada comes to Los Angeles when he isn't able to find a job in Denver. The whole economy and society seems to be going to pot, but he falls in with a homeless community and gets a construction job. But then he gets suspicious of the comings and goings of some neighbors. When the police raid them, Nada helps others to flee then eventually comes into possession of a pair of sunglasses. Only, these sunglasses allow him to see the writing on the walls... literally. Aliens have taken control of society, and it is up to those who can see to bring it to an end.</p><p>This is cult classic. As allegory, this movie is wonderful (though, sadly, there are too many people who have these kinds of ideas literally). My favorite subconscious message is to \"Marry and Reproduce.. There are also numerous lines that will last through the ages (or at least among people of my age)... bubblegum, anyone. I was also a fan of pro-wrestling as a kid, so \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper is a pleasure to watch, particularly in gratuitous fight scenes.</p><p>If you didn't grow up with this film, I'm not sure you'd be interested in it. It isn't Carpenter's best, but certainly my favorite of his. I'd be happy if more people saw this film, but I know that's just not going to happen.</p>
80496|oldboy|DVD at home|2004-07-22|<p>Oh Dae-su disappears on his daughter's birthday in 1988. When he wakes up, he is imprisoned in what looks like a hotel room. On the TV, he gets to learn that his wife has been killed and that he is the chief suspect. Vowing revenge, he trains himself for fifteen years before he is free. Once out, he is confronted with the task of figuring and who imprisoned him and why. The beautiful young Mido also comes into his life, helping him to seek out vengeance, but also becoming a new liability in his fight.</p><p>Park Chan-Wook is certainly looking to corner the market on disturbing films. This one ends up being even more twisted and involved than <short=\"sympathyformrvengeance\" title=\"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance\">Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance</a>, though on some levels more interesting. We've got good actors assembled here, particularly the lead, Choi Min-Sik. There are also many plot twists that you just cannot see coming. The film is put together quite nicely as well - I particularly liked the flashback scenes to high school that switch back and forth smoothly as the memory gets jogged. For a movie about a man psychologically battered and manipulated for fifteen years, it does have a vaguely positive turn at the very end, but even this is food for thought.</p><p>It is hard to recommend this film to someone I don't know, but I've given my caveats already. I liked the film, and didn't have any problem staying up way past my bedtime to watch the whole thing. If you are looking for a story that just wouldn't be told in American cinema, this is one to check out.</p>
80497|tellmesomething|DVD at home|2004-07-25|<p>When the parts of three different corpses turn up, Detective Cho is put on the case to track down the killer. The first break comes when they identify one of the victims. His listed next of kin, Su-Yeon, turns out to know all three victims. Problem is, Su-Yeon is not very talkative and only has a few people who would know her life intimately enough to be able to kill so many people close to her. As Cho and his partner work to track down the killer, the tension builds as suspects fall from the list.</p><p>I liked this movie. There are several scenes which many people will find more than a little disturbing, since we are dealing with severed body parts. The mystery, however, builds up quite well, and the director does a good job of keeping the tension high throughout the whole film... even after what we think is the climax. I thought the acting was pretty good as well, though there isn't much to say about the female lead, since she is silent and timid most of the time.</p><p>I'd recommend this to people interested in a good murder and suspense film. I had no trouble staying interested in this movie despite my flagging energy at the time.</p>
80498|kickthemoon|DVD at home|2004-07-25|<p>In high school, Young-Jun was the ostracized nerd who didn't fight. Ki-Woong was the most popular kid who led the fight. Now, Young-Jun is a gangster, come into town to take over the local operations, and Ki-Woong is a teacher who is trying to get his kids to follow a better path than he did in high school. Meeting up after all these years, the two become friends. But then the sister of one student catches both of their eyes, and it becomes a competition to see who can woo her and get her brother to get better grades.</p><p>This is the same director as one of my favorite comedies, <short=\"attackthegasstation\" title=\"Attack the Gas Station\">Attack the Gas Station!</a>, although I didn't realize it until after I'd rented it. I'd heard good things about the movie, though. I was, however, disappointed. The funniest scenes for me were with the old cop tossing his wallet all the time. I didn't like any of the three main characters. They all lacked enough redeeming qualities or endearing features to make them truly likeable. As a result, I just didn't care about them. I couldn't root for either of them to \"get the girl,\" since I found the woman's personality mildly offensive as well - no matter how cute she was. The final, chaotic battle was just a let down.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. It isn't horrible, but it just isn't worth sitting through. There are far superior comedies out there.</p>
80499|loveletter|DVD at home|2004-07-26|<p>Hiroko attends the 2-year memorial service for her departed fiance. Visiting his mother, she gets his address from junior high school and decides to write a simple love letter. The trick is, there were two Fujii Itsuki in the school, and the woman who shares his name gets the letter and responds. To satisfy Hiroko's curiosity, Itsuki begins to recount to the stranger her memories of the boy she knew for three years in school.</p><p>Nakayama Miho is actually playing both female characters here. It  comes across pretty well, though what that means for the departed male character is never resolved. This is a really good romance, though I think it should be said before watching that the Hiroko character is NOT the protagonist. This misconception - fueled by the summaries and the way the film starts out - left me disappointed for part of the film, since the Hiroko character is not developed. Her current situation (is it a boyfriend?) isn't likable or developed as well. Instead, this story is just the fuel for the telling of a more romantic tale. The real power of this romance for me was that it builds slowly (and somewhat unexpectedly) instead of hitting you hard over the head, making it much more enjoyable and endearing.</p><p>As far as romances go, this is definitely one of the better ones. Not necessarily realistic, but an enjoyable watch that will likely bring some females to tears.</p>
80500|foulking|DVD at home|2004-07-27|<p>Dae-Ho has a boring job as a banker, and he isn't very good at it either. His boss has it in for him and will even put him in a headlock to vent. Then Dae-Ho sees a Pro-Wrestling gym and decides to try to join. For their own reasons, they end up taking him so that they can put out a wrestler who specializes in cheating. All the while, though, Dae-Ho is determined to be the best and maybe even stand up to his boss.</p><p>Maybe it is the wrestling fan that still hides in the back of my psyche from childhood, but this movie appealed to me a lot. The characters, particularly our lead, were wonderful. Dae-Ho has an innocence about him that comes across very genuine. There is a violent tinge to the humor, but it is firmly in the realm of fantasy. My stomach actually hurt at one point because I was laughing so hard.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to anyone. It quickly moved itself into position to be one of my favorite comedies in recent memory. Watch it if you can.</p>
80501|heartsandminds|Video at UCLA|2004-07-28|<p>As the U.S. involvement in Viet Nam was winding down, this documentary recapped the events and personalities behind it, as well as the effect it had on the American and Vietnamese people. Personal interviews with politicians and soldiers get underneath some of the rhetoric. Footage in the U.S. and Viet Nam help reveal what happened on the ground. The primary focus is on how the U.S. carried out the war and the way it affected everyone.</p><p>This is a powerful documentary that gets at many aspects of the war. Obviously, there are many areas that are left untouched or are touched upon only superficially. For example, you don't see anything about the role the unrest among America's black population played in ending the war - despite its significance as even admitted by one of the interviewees in <strong>The Pentagon Papers</strong>. There is not much on the north Vietnamese, either, besides a little bit on Ho Chi Minh. But you get to see the transformation of soldiers quite well - how they saw themselves going into the war, even volunteering for it. You also get to see the way that they treated and thought about the people there. And most significantly, you get to see the rhetoric which the government used. This is most important because it hasn't changed... they continue to use the same rhetoric when pressing a war against Iraq. They even use some of the exact same phrases.</p><p>Especially for those who know little about the Viet Nam War except through movies, this is a must-see. The analysis isn't deep, but it is a start. Unfortunately, no one in the film is able to present an opinion about the war except as a \"mistake\" - an assessment which is flawed and does not understand the nature of the United States. Don't let that stop you from watching it. Then you can go out and read a few good books, like <strong>Vietnam Wars 1945 - 1990</strong> by Marilyn Young.</p>
80502|ohsoojung|DVD at home|2004-08-01|<p>Soo-Jung is a young assistant to an independent film director. One of the director's friends (a source of financial support) shows interest in Soo-Jung and begins trying to woo her. Over a short period, they meet several times, but it is never clear what Soo-Jung is interested in - the man is clearly interested in sex.</p><p>This is an art film, through and through. It was filmed in black and white. We get segmented bits of story that take us through the events, then at the half-way point we start all over again with the same story but from a slightly different perspective. It is never clear which perspective is which, since neither seems to be that on any one individual. Sometimes segments in the second half compliment the first half, but at other times they contradict, throwing the viewer into confusion as to what the \"real\" story is. This is obviously on purpose, but in the end I couldn't see exactly what the director was going for with the film. We get glimpses at conflicted, tormented, but ultimately unlikeable characters interacting, supposedly to tell us something about male-female relationships.</p><p>I definitely recommend against this film. I had trouble staying awake, and ended up watching the movie in parts over three days before finally finishing it. I suppose I was hoping for a payoff in resolution or at least something to provoke thoughts, but ended up barren.</p>
80503|takecareofmycat|DVD at home|2004-08-02|<p>Five girls from Inchon were the best of friends in high school, but one year later, they are struggling to stay close and figure out their own place in the world. Tae-Hee is still working without wages for her parents and dreams of escaping from Korea all together. Hye-Ju has gotten a job as an office girl in Seoul and clearly aspires to be more important than she is. Ji-Young struggles just to get a job, coming home to the dilapidated house where her grandparents live. The twins, Bi-Ryu and Ohn-Jo, have each other and seem to make their living making and selling jewelry.</p><p>This is a movie about coming of age, and how different people handle it. It also brings in some of the hardships of Inchon and what faces the youth of that city. We quickly get a good sense of the three main characters (the twins aren't really explored in depth), a true testament to the writing and directing. Their problems are very real and believable, and I think most people even near these women in age will be able to relate to the situation. The movie ends up being touching without being sappy, and exploring some humor as well that keeps the flow of the film fresh.</p><p>I would recommend this film. Unlike many Korean dramas, it has a happy ending that is somewhat expected, but it fits quite well with the movie.</p>
80504|spiderman|DVD at home|2004-08-18|<p>I recently bought the DVD, but I'd already seen this <short=\"spiderman\" title=\"Spider-Man\">movie</a> in the theaters when it came out. Nothing much to add for this viewing except to say that I still think it is an exceptional movie for a comic-book adaptation.</p>
80505|collateral|United Artists Pasadena Marketplace 6|2004-08-20|<p>Cab driver, Max, after dropping off a passenger and potential date, picks up Vincent. Vincent takes a liking to Max, probably because of their shared obsessive-compulsive tendencies, and decides to hire him for the night. But Vincent needs to be driven around L.A. so that he can carry out several contract killings. As the mayhem collects, the police and FBI soon pick up the smell of something funny, and it becomes a race to see if the killings can be stopped before Vincent catches his morning flight out of L.A.</p><p>Despite the fight-or-flight instinct that Tom Cruise inspires in me, I'd heard enough good things about this film that when some friend invited me to see it I figured I'd give it a try. The film is put together quite well, too. Jamie Foxx is a great actor, and together with his upcoming role in <strong>Ray</strong>, he should really come into his own as a quality actor and not just a screwball comedian. Cruise, since he plays an egomaniac and doesn't have to act to do that, does a pretty good job, too. The mood of the movie is slow-building and involved, which will throw off anyone looking for an action movie. I quite liked the dialogue, and although some of it was hard to follow for the noise, it came together to create a truly interesting, if somewhat predictable, story. My main complaint about the film was the abuse of locations. At the same time that the movie seems to be making love to the ins-and-outs of Los Angeles, it also abuses anyone who knows the city by routing the cab past the airport from Pico-Rivera to Koreatown and having our hero driving west to east in the northern part of downtown and then suddenly driving north from the south part of downtown. These seemed like simple changes that could have been dealt with better, for continuity's sake. Or maybe this just reveals my own obsessive-compulsive behaviors that make me sympathize with the main character.</p><p>This isn't film classic, but it is worth watching. It isn't deeply thought provoking, but will stir you up a little bit, as it isn't a complete throw-away film.</p>
80506|spiderman2|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2004-08-21|<p>It wasn't all that long ago that I saw this <short=\"spiderman2\" title=\"Spider-Man 2\">movie</a>. I don't have much more to add, though obviously I liked the movie quite a lot to go see it in the theater twice.</p>
80507|clashofthetitans|DVD at home|2004-08-22|<p>When Perseus, yet another of Zeus' illegitimate children with a mortal, is tossed out to sea as an infant to die with his mother, Zeus intercedes and makes sure that they land safely while seeing to the destruction of Argos. Meanwhile, as punishment for the slaying of Zeus' herd of winged horses, Zeus punishes Thetis' son, Calibos. This affects Andromeda, slated to marry Calibos, and setting up Perseus with a goal once he comes of age. With several gifts from the gods, he sets out to break Calibos' curse upon Andromeda, but then their planned marriage sets up a cycle of revenge which sets Perseus on a quest to save his betrothed from the anger of Calibos and Thetis.</p><p>This movie started playing on TV when I was in elementary school and was, therefore, my first real introduction to Greek mythology and legends. It laid the groundwork for my involvement in <a href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/welcome\" title=\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> and a general interest in mythology, though I have to admit the Greeks never interested me as much as the Norse. I think the movie is still amazing for what it does, especially the incorporation of numerous mythological figures on screen. The acting is good, collecting a number of famous actors and actresses for important roles, and the story holds up well as myth. Liberties are taken, but they are done well.</p><p>This film probably best fits into the realm of cult classic, and is worth watching no matter where you place it. It is must-see for anyone interested in the fantasy film genre, and should please any number of people besides.</p>
80508|planetoftheapes|DVD at home|2004-08-23|<p>After a pioneering mission into outspace, the crew of an American spacecraft are preparing to return to an Earth that has aged much faster than they have (due to light-speed travel on their part). But while in suspended animation, something goes wrong and they crash into an unknown planet. Forced to abandon ship, the three survivors start searching for signs of life. They eventually find humans, but they don't speak. Before they know it, ape men are rounding them up and killing many of them. We quickly learn that this planet is run by apes on the cusp of grasping Darwinian theories, but who see humans as mere beasts.</p><p>This is one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made. Its flaws, of which there are only a few, are primarily due to the limitations of cinema magic of the late 60s. The story itself is a wonderful exploration of our own ideas of war, evolution, religion, the environment, and a number of other weighty topics... all delivered in a medium that keeps you entertained along the way and intrigued by where the story will lead.</p><p>This is classic film, and hence should be seen by anyone who has any self-respect and calls themselves a movie fan.</p>
80509|hero|Pacific Culver Stadium 12|2004-08-28|<p>Wow, almost a year and a half since I first saw this <short=\"hero\"view=2003-03-28 title=\"Hero\">movie</a>. Definitely glad I got a chance at last to see it on a big screen. The film is still amazingly beautiful, and really among one of the must-see movies of the year for anyone with even a taste for art-house films. And there's plenty of ass kicking, to boot.</p>
80510|nikita|DVD at home|2004-09-03|<p>The young Nikita, doped up on drugs, ends up killing a cop when her friends try to rob a pharmacy. She doesn't make matters any better for herself, stabbing another officer while in custody. She is sentenced to a minimum of 30 years before parole, but then is taken in for \"execution.. Her choice is to train as an assassin for the French government or take up residence in the plot where her body is supposedly buried.</p><p>This was my introduction to Luc Besson many years ago, and it is still one of his greatest films. This isn't just a silly action movie, as the plot might lead one to believe. Instead, we have a few (satisfying) assassinations and action scenes, interspersed with a female character who grows and loves in a way that is unexpected. The kick-ass side of Nikita is balanced against the heart that develops within her. As contrived as the plot is, it works masterfully at telling a story that we want to see.</p><p>This is one of the greats, and I would recommend it to anyone. If you've suffered through one of the remakes but have never seen the original, please do yourself a favor.</p>
80511|napoleondynamite|Laemmle Sunset 5 Theatre|2004-09-04|<p>Napoleon is at the bottom of the food chain in his remote, Idaho high school. Things just seem to go from bad to worse when his grandmother gets in an accident and his uncle comes in to run the house. But a new kid at school, Pedro, provides him with a new friendship. They struggle through getting a date to the school dance in their own ways. Then Pedro decides that he wants to run for school president against the most popular girl in school.</p><p>There are many hilarious scenes in this movie... things I was remembering for the next couple days and laughing about. The movie is slow-moving in its plot, but the humor is consistent throughout. I'm not sure how to describe the style of humor used in the film. It is quirky, relying heavily on the absurd and the contrast with anything that seems reasonable for a normal person to do. I'd recommend watching the trailer. If you find it funny, you are really going to like this film. If you don't like this kind of humor, then stay away, because that's all it is. There is some great acting all around, though, with personalities that really stand out.</p><p>A fun movie with devoted fans, it plays to a specific audience who should be able to sort themselves out. </p>
80512|taegukgi|United Artists Pasadena Marketplace 6|2004-09-05|<p>Jin-Tae shines shoes and wants to be a shoemaker, but also is determined to see that his younger brother, Jin-Seok, goes to college. He also has plans to marry that get put on hold when war finally breaks out in 1950. As the family tries to flee to southern Korean, Jin-Seok is forcefully drafted. Jin-Tae joins him when he cannot get his brother free, and then strikes a deal with his commanding officer: if he can win a medal, his brother will be able to go home. Jin-Tae then sets off to win a medal, but Jin-Seok isn't happy about this and doesn't like what he sees his brother becoming.</p><p>This is a complex film with plenty of thought-provoking material. There are definitely problems with the plot and script. The final situation between the two brothers is just lame and avoidable. There are a couple other scenes which are contrived but at least work toward developing the main characters. For some reason, the Hersey bar also annoys me for its inconsistency, but that's no reason to avoid the film. There is also homage to <strong>Saving Ryan's Privates</strong>, visually and in the score, which annoyed me since I am of the opinion that that film is one of the worst of recent years. The film does a descent job of showing what conditions must have been like at the time, and particularly the situation at home for the girlfriend and mother. It shows the authoritarian nature of both governments, though the depiction of the northern forces is limited to battlefield brutality which seemed a little lopsided. In the end, the movie is about two brothers getting to really know each other under the most adverse of circumstances. Although there are politics infused throughout, they come across as semi-neutral at times, putting problems out there that aren't necessarily answered. I thought that the soldiers' discussions could have been better, since the somewhat more rational voice is counterbalanced by having the character who is speaking them being fatalistic.</p><p>For fans of Korean cinema or those with an interest in Korean history, this is worth watching. There are holes and problems, but the movie overall is good. I'll pass on one other warning, which is that the film is quite shakey, which sometimes makes it hard to distinguish characters when the scene changes.</p>
80513|zatouichi|Loews Cineplex Beverly Center Cineplex|2004-09-06|<p>Zatouichi, a masseur, comes into town and befriends an older woman. This remote town, somehow devoid of law, is under the thumb of a yakuza band that is increasing their extortion demands and rapidly wiping out their competition. Also in town is a ronin, looking to hire himself out as a yojimbo, so that he can afford medication for his sick wife. Zatouichi also manages to befriend the woman's nephew, who is addicted to gambling, a pasttime that the masseur also shares. Then the final ingredient in the mix are two geisha siblings who are looking to carry out revenge for the murder of their family some ten years ago.</p><p>This movie is violent and hilarious, pretty much what one should expect from \"Beat\" Takeshi. The swordfighting is fast and CGI enhanced, particularly with the spurting of blood and severing of limbs. This, however, works for the film quite well, I think. Compared to other Takeshi films I've seen, this one is by far the funniest, and that it plays with the whole chambara genre and the Zatouichi character makes it that much more enjoyable to people aware of those films. There are, unfortunately, huge holes in the plot and characterizations. It does detract from the film somewhat, leaving several scene feeling either unnecessary or unexplained. Importantly, there are characters that we feel we should care about, but don't seem to have enough reason to. Without a grounding in Japanese culture, some things are just not going to make sense to the viewer.</p><p>I liked the film, and definitely recommend it to people who, like myself, have a mean stream firmly implanted in their humor. The film is gorey and should be avoided by people who don't have a stomach for this.</p>
80514|killbillvol2|DVD at home|2004-09-11|<p>The Bride continues on the warpath, but now everyone knows she is coming. Bill tries to warn Budd, but he seems uninterested in teaming up to stop her. Elle, our one-eyed assassin, and Budd do become intertwined after he seems to have taken down our hero. Meanwhile, we get flashbacks to the training and past that put the Bride on her current path. In the end, we know she'll get to Bill, but we aren't sure how that will play out.</p><p>The first <short=\"killbillvol1\" title=\"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\">movie</a> left me somewhat disappointed and not willing to shell out the  money to go see Vol. 2 in the theaters. But people kept telling me about it, so I decided to give it a chance on DVD. This movie definitely makes up for the first one. The story is much more interesting and enjoyable here. We see a return to some quality dialogue as well as some great action set-ups. The fight between the Bride and Elle got rewinded so that I could watch it again and laugh some more. I was really impressed with Carradine here. I never got to see much of the old TV series that made him famous, but had developed a very negative impression of his current abilities. But that's his martial arts, in this movie it is his acting that left me amazed. He isn't the only one with a solid performance, either, which makes the film that much more engaging.</p><p>This isn't one of those films that needs much recommending, but then I guess I needed it. If you like Tarantino films, and particularly if you are versed in the chambara, kung-fu, and western movies this movie is steeped in, then you should definitely check it out.</p>
80515|anarchists|DVD at home|2004-09-14|<p>In Shanghai, 1924, the Korean exile community is filled with political factions. One is anarchist, and they start out story by helping the narrator, Sang-Gu, escape from hanging by the Japanese. After some training, he joins with four others in planning and carrying out terrorist attacks and assassinations against Japanese officials in Shanghai. But this extreme tactic brings them into conflict with the others in the Korean community, most importantly the exhile government. This leads to the set-up of Sergi, and the group being forced to act independently.</p><p>Although there is an interesting story here, it isn't fleshed out nearly enough. First of all, we have characters who are defined by their politics, but for all intents and purposed, we don't see their politics outside of them having enough hatred for their colonizers to want to kill them. A couple parts of the film allow some mention of socialism to peek in, but not on any meaningful level. There is some political statement in the movie, but it never feels like it is posing political questions to the viewer. Overall, the acting seems pretty good. There were a couple of other things that annoyed me though. First, the movie presents itself as a historical drama, but then throws in some off-kilter action. The gun battles aren't bad, but the training segment only provides comedic relief. What also annoyed me was the fluid crossing of ethnic boundaries for roles. I didn't realize until half-way through the film that the female love interest of Sergei was actually supposed to be Japanese. This is because she is quite clearly Korean, with Korean features and speaking Korean. The Chinese characters are played by Chinese, for the most part.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film. It isn't horrible, but it doesn't really seem worthwhile, either. Production values are there for many things, but the story and characters just don't hold up. This is sad, too, because it is interesting material that could have been a better story.</p>
80516|nabi|DVD at home|2004-09-15|<p>\"After 2001... A city somewhere in Korea... An 'oblivion virus' that erases memories wanders in a city polluted by acid rain and lead poisoning. Many people started to visit to rid themselves of their painful memories.. So begins the movie. Anna is in the airport, having come from Germany where she has been living abroad for many years. She has some sort of terrible memory she hopes to forget, and so she has paid for a Butterfly tour. Her guide Yuki, a young woman who turns out to be pregnant and ill, is to help her track down and contract the virus. Their driver, also employed by Butterfly has his own past that he is hoping to track down along the way.</p><p>This movie has the sense that it was shot on a very small budget, but that the director and the camera work do an absolutely masterful job of working around that. The scenes capture a sense of the distopic future quite effectively, while maintaining the focus on the three characters. The three actors also put in great performances, highly charged with emotion and purpose. Many things remain a mystery, even by the end of the film, but they are able to leek out some sense of that mystery. The movie is, of course, about memory, but also about pain and its role in human experience. On a sci-fi level, it could be compared somewhat to <short=\"eternalsunshine\" title=\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a>, which deals with similar themes but in a more light-hearted and romantic manner. With that comparison, I have to say that I like the approach of this movie better. I'm still struggling to sort out the ideas in my mind, to make sense of the movie for myself - and that is something a good movie will do.</p><p>This movie seems obscure, and probably quite hard to get hold of, but if you have a chance to watch it, I'd recommend it. It is slow and involving, not fast-paced action, but that's what makes it good sci-fi.</p>
80517|thewayhome|DVD at friend's house|2004-09-19|<p>7-year-old Sang-Woo is taken to the countryside by his mother, so that she can leave him with his 77-year-old grandmother while she takes care of her own problems. Sang-Woo's absence of a father shows through readily in the way that he treats his mute grandmother. But she doesn't let it phase her, treating him with care and concern despite his rude behavior. When the batteries run out on his favorite game, he steps outside the house to go in search of them. Then he meets a couple other children in the village, a young girl in particular who catches his eye. Amazingly, other people seem to be able to communicate with the grandmother without difficulty, and eventually Sang-Woo will have to learn as well, before his mother returns to pick him up.</p><p>There isn't much unexpected about the plot of this film, and it is at its core the family film that you expect it to be. This doesn't, however, mean that it isn't worth watching. The grandmother is amazing, and the scenes are touching when they need to be, humorous when they can be. The film is also a tribute to remote village life in Korea at the same time praising grandmothers everywhere.</p><p>There isn't much more to say about this wholesome film. I liked it and I think anyone who can appreciate such a story should check it out. If you get it on DVD and can watch the making of documentary, that's worth it, too, just to see the elderly woman who'd never acted before as herself.</p>
80518|samaria|Egyptian Theatre|2004-09-25|<p>Yeo-Jin and Jae-Yeong are young highschool students. In hopes of traveling overseas, Jae-Yeong is prostituting herself out to older men. Yeo-Jin takes care of the arrangements and money. When one session goes wrong, Yeo-Jin decides to seek absolution through prostituting herself.</p><p>This doesn't get at the plot very well, but it is hard to discuss the plot in more detail without giving too much away. This is a powerful film, filled with symbolism, thought-provoking situations, and social commentary. I'm well aware of the prostitution problem in Japan, since it was a hot topic when I was there nearly a decade ago, but this was the first I'd heard of it for South Korea. This film is the most tasteful take on the problem that I've seen. Although many things remain unsaid, the relationships between the different characters come out through their acting and the situations that add a depth that could easily take another half hour of film time to demonstrate otherwise. We get a peek into the minds of two teenagers who are willing to prostitute themselves. We get further insight into the men who sleep with them and the father of Yeo-Jin, who cares about her dearly. When I finished watching this film, it took me some time and discussion to really begin to feel like I'd gotten my head around it.</p><p>I do want to convey two warnings. First, the version I watched didn't bother to subtitle the IM conversation at the beginning of the film, despite it being extremely important to setting up the first third of the movie. The conversation is between one of the girls and a future john. They discuss terms and, in particular, their fear of the police. Thanks to the Korean friend sitting next to me in the movie for explaining this. Second - and this really confused me until explained by my friend - the white SUV that pulls up at the end is NOT the same white SUV from the middle of the film. I couldn't for the life of me figure out what the character from the middle of the film would be doing here... and it turns out he wasn't.</p><p>For some, the symbolism at the end might be a little overboard, but I still think this is a great movie and have no doubts why it won top prize at Berlin. Because of the subject matter and the state of puritanical values in the U.S., I don't expect this film to get art house circulation, so if you want to see it, I recommend trying to track it down on DVD.</p>
80519|agoodlawyerswife|DVD at home|2004-09-29|<p>Eun's husband is rarely home, and when he is he certainly doesn't fulfill her needs as a woman or their adopted son's needs. This is, of course, because he's having an affair with another woman. In frustration, Eun begins to respond to the passes made at her by the neighbor's boy, a 16-year-old high school drop-out. To make matters worse, he gets in an accident while on  vacation with his mistress and has to figure out a way to cover it up so that his wife does not find out.</p><p>I'm generally not a fan of any movie that involves spouses cheating on one another, but this one was quite good. Eun isn't without blame, either, as her decision to begin fooling around isn't in response to knowledge of her husband's affair, which comes later. The result is an exploration of sexuality that's more mature than I've come to expect from films. There is a gratuitous amount of nudity in the film - i.e., nudity that doesn't really add to the story only to the titillation of the (male) audience - which throws it off a little. This is the only film I can think of that has a mature treatment of sex as catharsis, though (it is more off-hand in most of the other films I can think of). Be warned, however, that men don't get any positive presentation in this film. I didn't interpret this as an attempt to label all men as immature, just as a vehicle to move our heroine to the place the creators wanted her to be.</p><p>I really enjoyed the film. I wouldn't say it was must-see viewing, but I could recommend it to any number of people.</p>
80520|musa|Korean Cultural Center|2004-09-30|<p>14th century China sees the ascendance of the Ming Dynasty. The Koryo of the Korean peninsula kill their first envoy, and in retaliation the Ming kill or imprison any people the Koryo send. Our story takes up the fate of one envoy who is exiled instead. In exile, the soldiers guarding them are killed by Yuan troops, and so our characters are left to fend for themselves. The young general of the Koryo troops takes charge to get the group out of the desert. But then the opportunity arises to rescue a Ming princess, which could mean not only the possibility of everyone returning home but of also winning the favor of the Ming court. But the group has to survive and carry her back into Ming-controlled territory before they will ever see home.</p><p>There was an array of characters that I cannot even begin to distinguish here, but they were all well fleshed-out - perhaps the reason why this movie runs as long as it does. All the characters are flawed, showing their darker sides at several stressing moments throughout the story. For the most part, this makes them believable. The two exceptions are the general and the Ming princess, who are perhaps a little too romanticized in their actions. The fighting is fairly good, too. Some flashy stuff, but nothing on the level of wuxia that one might expect from a period piece with Zhang Ziyi in it. Be warned that the violence gets graphic at time, with clear visual shots of arrows passing through necks and limbs being severed. These combat scenes are frenetic, a conscious decision by the director I'm sure, which adds a flavor to them, but then also seems to short-change the fight choreography from time to time as well. The most grating flaw of the film is the music. There are several scenes where the music choice is just wrong and downright laughable.</p><p>The film was fun to watch, and if you find yourself drawn to this type of film you will certainly want to check it out. The historical context makes it interesting. I wouldn't recommend it people whose interests don't like in this genre, though.</p>
80521|allaboutlilychouchou|DVD at home|2004-10-01|<p>Hasumi spends his time with friends, doing things like shoplifting CDs for resale to used CD stores. He gets into Lily Chou-Chou's music through a friend, but when he is caught stealing the CD his teacher and mother are brought in. Hoshino comes from another school with a reputation for being a good student. He soon establishes himself as a renegade, stealing money from a wealthy man and then everyone using the money to take a trip to Okinama. He nearly dies there, but this only seems to invigorate his disrespect for others when he returns. Back in school, he is forcing girls to prostitute themselves and being an all-around bully. Hasumi is one of those people, used by him and pushed around by him. The only thing they seem to share is a taste in music, though even this is anonymous for most of the film.</p><p>First of all, this film is beautifully shot. Most of it seems to be digital, with crisp, clear images that are just stunning. The Okinawa section is shot with video cameras, which is jarring at first but adds to the flavor of the scenes. The music is also well placed. For me the film was rather disjointed and hard to follow at times (partly because I watched it in two parts with a half-day intermission). I think this is conscious, though, since this is a story about growing up and the pressures that junior high school kids face in Japan. Hence, the film is also not uplifting, because there is little to praise in the subject matter - the state of Japanese (and all?) youth being what it is. The story ends up twisting and moving us in ways that I liked, though, even with the mildly depressing direction it heads.</p><p>This is an art film, unlike the other Iwai films I've either seen or heard about. It is a commentary upon Japanese youth that seeks to portray them from where they are, not from some overly-critical or outside viewpoint. For that reason, I would recommend it to people concerned with the questions it raises. I'm even inclined to watch it again soon, simply to be able to sort out the film for myself.</p>
80522|stateofsiege|Video at friend's house|2004-10-02|<p>Philip Michael Santore officially works for the USAID in Uruguay, but after he is kidnapped by the Tupamara guerrilla group, the true nature of his job in Montevideo becomes clearer. He has been hopping from one Latin American country to another, working for the U.S. government to help establish death squads, prop up dictators or pending coups, and generally train the forces of repressing in those countries in counter-insurgency and torture. While the small leftist group interrogates their prisoner, the forces of the government are carrying out a reign of terror against the local population, trying to recover the American and Brazilian nationals who've been kidnapped. The movie is based on actual events that took place in the early 1970s, when Daniel Mitrione was kidnapped.</p><p>This is one of those great political films that needs to be made available again. We had to watch an old VHS copy that was dubbed and pan-and-scan. The movie gives you a run down of events, not only from the interviews, but through flashbacks, an investigative journalist, and the actions of the state and U.S. forces. Ironically, I understand that this film was shot in Chile shortly before their government fell to yet another CIA-backed coup. I also liked that the film doesn't completely romanticize the guerrillas. We see that they have a loosely democratic structure, but we also see how the population reacts to them when they are stealing cars for the kidnapping. Santore is also able to put a question to them that shows the desperation and hopelessness of their strategy, as does the ending itself.</p><p>If you can get hold of this, it is a film that should be seen. Sadly, this early Costa-Gavras film is not yet on DVD and is out of print in the U.S.</p>
80523|shaunofthedead|Mann Criterion in Santa Monica|2004-10-02|<p>Shaun's life is in a rut. His girlfriend, Liz, isn't happy with this either and wants out. Part of the reason is Ed, Shaun's friend and roommate who no one likes. And then the people of London start turning into zombies. Soon, Shaun must rise to the task of protecting his mother and regaining his girlfriend, all while fighting off zombies left and right.</p><p>Even without knowledge of the zombie genre, this film would have been funny. But, with that under your belt, this film becomes a must-see. Things don't get all that scary, but the dialogue is top notch and everyone provides their own separate element to the humor. The social commentary is in there and not heavy handed in my opinion, in fact I think it could have been stronger.</p><p>If you are looking for a nice absurd comedy about zombies, then check out this film. You won't be disappointed.</p>
80524|withoutapaddle|Edwards Valencia Grand Palace Stadium|2004-10-03|<p>Three childhood friends reunite for the funeral of a fourth, who has died while living on the edge. As they sort through his belongings back in the old tree house, they come across a map. But this map has been updated recently to mark the probably location of D.B. Cooper's treasure - a hot news story from their childhood. Soon, the three of them are off on a canoe trip into the wild for which none of them are prepared.</p><p>This is a throw-away movie that's good for a lazy Sunday when you've got nothing better to do with your friends. I enjoyed the film, though that may have been in part due to the pint I had right before the movie. This isn't roll-on-the-floor humor, but the level of humor and the absurd situations keep up throughout the film. Burt Reynolds is cool, too. The biggest lure of this film is that the main characters are all exactly the same age as me. This means that the culture that they are immersed in from childhood on is the one I grew up with, so I knew nearly all the songs and references. Without that, the film would have had less of an appeal.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend that anyone watch the film, but you could do worse. The moral at the end is a nice one, even if a bit of a stretch for the characters in hand.</p>
80525|asakoinrubyshoes|DVD at home|2004-10-04|<p>U-In is a 27-year-old clerk at a local community office in Seoul. He has little skills when it comes to women and even his coworkers know him to spend time looking at internet porn - or at least trying, since he doesn't pay for anything. When an woman with flaming red hair grabs his attention, he fixates on her and even finds a site online with a woman, Asako, who looks similar.  Aya is a couple year out of high school in Japan, but is very unhappy with her life. She dreams of holding her breath until she dies. Then she strikes upon the idea of dying as she crosses the international date line. To afford it, she is eventually led to an adult web site production company, where she puts on a red wig and poses for the viewer at home.</p><p>Yeah, this sounds weird, but the film actually works. First and foremost it is a comedy, as there is little romance that makes it on screen - although the focus is on two lonely people looking for something else. Both the main characters are performed well - Lee Jung-Jae's facial expressions are wonderful. U-In is a little creepy as a character, but he isn't as porn obsessed as some reviewers make him out to be. To me, he seems not unlike any male of his age with no dating skills. His handling of the Chinese-Korean woman who he dates a couple times highlights this well. Everyone in the movie seems to be out of place in one sense of the word or another, and the story is about two people trying to find places for themselves.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to someone who can enjoy a quirky comedy. The film could be a little depressing at times to some, and one scene in particular at the end is pretty heavy with that emotion. But everything recovers by the end, even if it doesn't do so in a way that would make you feel particularly uplifted.</p>
80526|waneeandjunah|DVD at home|2004-10-09|<p>Wanee and Junah have been living together, unmarried, in Wanee's home for some time now, but Wanee keeps this fact a secret from just about everyone, particularly her mother (who presumably owns the home). This situation is clearly straining on their relationship, as Wanee avoids moving forward - and not just in her relationship but at work as well. With her brother scheduled to come back into town after several years studying abroad, further tensions mount.</p><p>The movie is slow-moving, but you really get to know the characters. The taboo that the movie uses becomes obvious early on, even if it isn't fully revealed until later, but there are still surprises along the way. The actors do a great job at getting the characters across, and I found myself interested in their situation despite its unfamiliarity (obviously live-in lovers aren't such a big deal in the U.S.). The romance by the end of the film isn't the kind of melodramatic knock over the head that I like to avoid, but instead seemed to provide a realistic and positive resolution to the story.</p><p>If you are looking for an interesting romance, I would recommend this film. It is a little atypical and that helps it out a lot.</p>
80527|ju-on|DVD at friend's house|2004-10-09|<p>A community worker is sent to a house to look in on the occupants, since they have not responded to phone calls. There, she finds a grandmother who is in a state of shock and the house is in disarray. As the worker cleans up the house she hears sounds coming from an upstairs closet. Inside she find a five-year-old boy. But things aren't what they seem, and when she returns to the grandmother she witnesses the body being \"attacked\" some some black spirit. Separated into small vignettes, we learn about the horrible events that originally curse the house and periodically strike down those who come in contact with it.</p><p>With a U.S. remake on the way by the same director (his third attempt, actually, since the movie was first made for TV in 2000), this movie has gotten quite a bit of attention. The narrative style is interesting, and helps add to the flavor as well as the confusion (it moves forward and backward in time without warning). Overall, though, I didn't find the film that scary - and this isn't simply because I don't get scared by films easily. The actors try to portray a tension, but it just doesn't come across in my opinion. The movie was still fun and intersting, but not as amazing as I was brought to believe.</p><p>If you are really into horror films, then you might want to check this out, but I wouldn't recommend this film to the layman. I certainly wouldn't shell out money to see an American remake. A note for those learning the Japanese language: this movie is very easy to understand. Despite my dwindling grasp of the language, I could understand most of it without aid of subtitles.</p>
80528|hamlet|Video at home|2004-10-13|<p>Within two months of his father's death, Hamlet's mother and uncle are married and his uncle is now upon the throne. Meanwhile, a military threat from Norway looms. Encountering the ghost of his father, Hamlet learns of the true nature of the king's death, but must bide his time to exact his revenge and seek justice. In the mean time, he feigns madness. The new king and his mother come to think that this is due to a spurned love of Ophelia.</p><p>Clocking in at over 4 hours, this version of the classic Shakespeare play reportedly keeps the entire script - whereas most other versions have abridged the work. The setting of the film is skewed from the play, looking to take place in the early 1800s, but otherwise there is little radical reinterpretation going on here. The acting is of the highest quality, and I was pleasantly surprised to see any number of famous faces popping into the film to play minor roles - this including Charlton Heston, Judi Dench, Robin Williams, Jack Lemmon, and Billy Crystal to name but a few. Although there were a few things that struck me as silly (the fencing costumes at the end), this was a worthwhile rendition of the play.</p><p>If you are a fan of Shakespeare, then this is definitely one of the better movie adaptations I have seen. I would recommend this film to anyone who doesn't have access to a proper theatre where the play is running to watch this as the next best thing.</p>
80529|bottlerocket|DVD at home|2004-10-23|<p>Anthony leaves the mental institution he's been at, picked up by his friend Dignan who has a 50-year plan on how they can become master criminals. Together with Bob, the rob a store and then go on the run (whether they need to or not). At the hotel they hole up at, Anthony meets one of the housekeepers, Inez, and they fall in love. Returning home, Dignan makes contact with Mr. Henry, the original inspiration for his criminal plots, and is soon inspired to try another round at the whole criminal lifestyle.</p><p>Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson write bizarre and funny films, and this was their first. To me, in wasn't rip-roaringly funny, but still quite enjoyable. The characters are all a little less than intelligent, but they at least come through for one another from time to time. On that level, I never get a sense that I can relate to the actions and characters, and maybe this is what keeps me from getting completely into the film.</p><p>I would recommend this film only to those who have already seen the later films by Wes Anderson. If you have enjoyed those and long for more, then you should definitely check out this one. If not, then you would be better to cut your teeth on one of them first, as they are a bit more refined through experience.</p>
80530|kwaidan|DVD at friend's house|2004-10-31|<p>The movie is actually four shorter stories not connected by anything other than they are all based on Japanese folk or ghost stories. \"Black Hair\" has a samurai divorcing his wife and leaving Kyoto so that he can marry another woman for a better position. In \"Snow Woman\" the woodcutter Minokichi witnesses the murder of his master by a snow maiden, who then spares his life because he is so handsome. There is one condition, though, that he must never tell anyone what he has witnesses or he will be killed. \"Hoichi the Earless\" is the story of a blind monk who is escorted every night to play his biwa before a ghostly court. When the older monks find out what is happening, they devise a plan to drive away the spirits. \"In a Cup of Tea\" has Kannai, a guard in early modern Japan, sees visions first in a cup of water and then while on duty. But the otherworldly vision won't leave him alone now that he has offended it.</p><p>Visually, these stories are beautiful, especially the \"Snow Woman,\" where the backgrounds are haunting matte paintings that resemble eyeballs and the like. The stories are fairly traditional - anyone familiar with even a smattering of east Asian folk tales will automatically know how \"Snow Woman\" is going to end, even if you haven't heard this particular tale before. The final tale was absolutely baffling, and I am still not able to make sense out of it. Coming at the end, this does sour the viewing a little, but not enough to say that it should be avoided.</p><p>If you are into artistic portrayals of folk tales, then you should probably check this film out. They aren't particularly scary stories, as the name and promotion material might suggest, but they are well crafted.</p>
80531|banshun|James Bridge Theater at UCLA|2004-11-04|<p>Noriko is in her twenties and still unmarried. She seems rather content taking care of her father Professor Somiya. But with some additional pressure from relatives and friends, the issue is not one she can easily avoid. Even one friend who is already divorced is pushing the idea on her. It seems only a matter of time before any omiyai must be put to work for her.</p><p>This is an amazing film for the time in which it is made... or rather, it seems rather amazing to us in our shortsidedness about people in the past. The attitudes expressed in the film are quite frank and open about the nature of marriage and relationships, and there are even sexual innuendos that are only thinly veiled. The focus of the movie is Noriko and her facing the changes that come with adulthood. It also deals with the conflicts between tradition and the modern age. On top of all this, there is plenty of humor interspersed between the wonderful black-and-white images that Ozu has put together.</p><p>Ozu considered this film his most favorite, and any number of other directors have concurred that it is his finest. If you are going to see any Ozu films (and you should see at least one), then this is a very good candidate.</p>
80532|aboutaboy|DVD at home|2004-11-06|<p>Will is about as shallow and self-centered as a man can get. At 38, he is unmarried and only his sister sees a problem with this. He lives off of royalties from a song his father wrote and has never worked a day in his life. The movie starts off with Will realizing that single mothers are a potential gold mine for relationships, and so he sets about trying to meet more of them. This lands him in contact with a young boy, Marcus, who forcefully inserts himself into Will's life.</p><p>There were times during this film that I laughed so hard I cried. The dual narrators along with the scene set-ups themselves are put together masterfully for comedic effect. And, of course, there is the touching aspect to the film, which comes across as fairly genuine. I'd never been much of a Hugh Grant fan, but he does an amazing job with this character.</p><p>Top-notch date film. I would recommend this to anyone. I was so pleasantly surprised with the humor that I wanted a little more.</p>
80533|ditto|DVD at girlfriend's house|2004-11-07|<p>You can see my earlier review of this film <short=\"ditto\" title=\"Ditto\">here</a>.</p>
80534|theincredibles|AMC Santa Monica 7|2004-11-11|<p>Fifteen years ago, Mr. Incredible was sued for damages that resulted from his trying to save lives. As a result, the superhero relocation program takes all the superheroes off the street and plants them in civilian jobs under their alter egos. But Incredible isn't so happy with his current job and longs to get back into action. When an opportunity arises, he has to sneak around to prevent his wife, the former Elastigirl, and children from finding out. But when things get bad, the whole family is going to have to get into the action.</p><p>Besides the excellent animation, which Pixar has already become widely known for, this is just an awesome story line. The characters are incredibly funny, and the voices used were well chosen. There are many jokes in there for the adults as well as the kids. If you are a comic book fan, then there are even little nuggets in there for you. This is definitely one of the best mainstream films of the year. As a special prize, there is also a great little animated short before the film which was fun, beautifully animates, and features a jackalope. How can you go wrong with that?!?</p><p>Unless you shun every last mainstream film, this is one everyone should see. I'm confident that theater tickets and DVD sales will show that most people agree.</p>
80535|ray|Pacific Culver Stadium 12|2004-11-19|<p>After losing his sight as a child, Ray must learn to fend for himself, and his mother realizes this. A virtuoso on the piano, he travels to begin making a name for himself. He soon learns that he has to take care of himself, that he cannot count on band members or managers to treat him fairly. Also while on the road, he picks up a heroin addiction that sticks with him for years, despite pleas by his wife and friends that he quit. And through all of this, the civil rights movement is gaining strength and Ray Charles has to be a part of it.</p><p>The acting is quite superb here, and certainly many people are talking about a well-deserved Oscar for Jamie Foxx. Many of the other actors do a great job as well, playing off of Foxx quite well. The focus of the story ends up being on his drug addiction and his dealing with the tragic event of his childhood. Some of the best scenes for me were the depictions of racism and how the artist dealt with them. My favorite contrast was between Georgia, where they ban him, versus the North, where they beat him up and try to ruin his career and life - an excellent demonstration of how racism plays out in the U.S. in different parts of the country. On top of all this, of course, is excellent music and an insight into how it was created.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film. It focuses on a more personal element that makes it an acceptable film for Hollywood, but the depiction of an artist's growth and his dealing with American racism are certainly worthwhile.</p>
80536|fogofwar|DVD at home|2004-12-01|<p>This documentary assembles interviews with Robert McNamara today with historical footage of one of the 20th century's big history-makers. As a young graduate, McNamara made a name for himself by helping the U.S. military kill Japanese more efficiently. After WWII, he moves over to Ford to eventually become their CEO. Within months, though, he is recruited by JFK to be the Secretary of Defense, in turn heading U.S. actions that accelerated the war against the Vietnamese people. Upon leaving that post several years later under the Johnson administration, he goes on to do work for the World Bank.</p><p>Ultimately, this documentary is sympathetic to McNamara, though sometimes asking him provoking questions which are often dodged. The structure of the documentary presents itself as lessons which McNamara learned, hence showing him as an \"enlightened\" statesman. The film, however, cannot avoid showing the man for who he was - an architect of considerable destruction. There are underlying questions which neither McNamara or Morris even tackle. And, I've personally heard recorded conversations between Johnson and McNamara which are much more damning than what is presented in the film - showing McNamara as more insidious than the film portrays him.</p><p>This film should only be watched by people who know a little about McNamara to begin with. It does provide valuable information and primary resources that anyone interested in U.S. history will want to see, but it skips some facts and trys to put a halo on a man who deserves horns.</p>
80537|houseofflyingdaggers|The Bridge, Howard Hughes Plaza|2004-12-04|<p>As the Tang Dynasty is settling into decay, the House of Flying Daggers has emerged as a group of assassins determined to bring the dynasty to an end. Leo, an official of the empire, is charged with tracking down the new head of the House, now that the last leader has just been executed. A blind woman, Mei, at a local entertainment house is suspected of being the daughter of the former leader, so Jin is sent undercover to get her to lead them to the new leader. Despite warnings from Leo, Jin falls for Mei. But there are more complications than that.</p><p>The cinematography of the film is quite gorgeous and the fights and (for lack of a better word) competitions are quite fun to watch. The story was quite engaging up to a point. Somewhere during the film, though, I had to lean over to my friend and ask if he'd ever seen Zhang Ziyi play a likeable character. We concluded that she has not - at least in the films we've seen. Leo is the tragic hero of this film, and he is sympathetic for the most part. He has a few flaws, but they are greatly overshadowed by that point in the film by the horrible direction the film is heading. As the final fight scene approached, the entire theater broke into laughter... and not because the director intended it that way. There is certainly a point to ponder by the last action of the film, but it isn't worth watching to that point.</p><p>I don't recommend this film. In fact, it gave me nightmares that I thought I'd put long behind me. Ziyi's character is absolutely despicable by the end of the film, and it is little consolation that the character is dead. If you do subject yourself to this film, stop watching it once you've figured out who Leo is.</p>
80538|quietfamily|DVD at girlfriend's house|2004-12-12|<p>The Kang family runs a lodge in a remote area. The promise of a paved road would likely bring them some guests, but now they have none. And then a few guests start showing up, but they end up killing themselves. To prevent the bad publicity from further hurting their already ailing business, they decide to bury the bodies in the woods. But as the road come in and an old friend of the father's complicates things, it will be hard to maintain this secret.</p><p>This is dark comedy, and they do a good job of it. There were pretty much non-stop laughs throughout most of the film. I was surprised to see some familiar faces here playing supporting roles. The characters are all fun, and the mother with her facial expressions are almost worth the film alone. Although an early work of the director and some of these actors, this one is definitely worth catching if you are into Korean films.</p><p>I recommend catching this film. Maybe rent it and take it with you to the cabin for the weekend.</p>
80539|newpolicestory|DVD at home|2004-12-14|<p>Inspector Wing has taken a year's absence from the Hong Kong Police Force after being the sole survivor on the hideout of a gang which robbed some major banks and killed cops for the pleasure of it. In the meantime, Wing has taken to some hard drinking and has alienated himself from his fiance. Then Fung shows up, forcing Wing to clean up his life and take the case back up. Putting together a few clues that lead to a group of extreme sports fans puts them hot on the trail of the group.</p><p>It is nice to see Jackie back in a Hong Kong film. Some of this Hollywood films have been fun, but their buddy formula gets a bit annoying - not to mention the limitations in place for Hollywood stunts and their propensity for CGI. There are some weird, inconsistent elements to this film, but it is definitely a Hong Kong film. In other words, the action is superior to just about anything out of the U.S. The weakest element of this film is the set-up: the death of Wing's team is a little absurd, to say the least. But it works with the rest of the film and leads up to the ending well. The one other things in the film that stuck in my craw a little was the age difference between Jackie and his love interest, but that's also to be somewhat expected I guess.</p><p>If you are a loyal enough fan that you've been watching the American films of Jackie Chan, then you will definitely want to get hold of this movie. It is refreshing after a string of stale pictures out of Hollywood and shows that Jackie still has a lot of potential, no matter what the major studios do to him.</p>
80540|officespace|Video at girlfriend's house|2004-12-16|<p>I've already reviewed this <short=\"officespace\" title=\"Office Space\">movie</a>. It still stands as one of the greatest American comedies ever made. See it!</p>
80541|jsa|DVD at girlfriend's house|2004-12-21|<p>Well, in my previous <short=\"jsa\" title=\"JSA\">review</a> of this film, I said I'd purchase this film if I wanted to see it again. Sure enough, I did. It is a great film, and I plan on lending it to some trustworthy friends so that they might see it as well.</p>
80542|twinseffect2|DVD at home|2004-12-25|<p>In the land of Huadu, an evil queen rules over the land, and all men are slaves. It is illegal to even fall in love with them. 13th Young Master is a slave-trader, making her living selling off \"dumb-bells.\" Blue Bird is a government agent, seeking to prevent the queen from being overthrown by the man prophesied to do so. Charcoal Head and Blockhead, under the care of Master Blackwood, are free males and theater actors who get their hands on a treasure map. Soon, the four of them are off in search of the treasure. Along the way they find some help and some hindrances, and develop feelings for one another.</p><p>I never saw the first movie, which is connected to this film only in the fact that The Twins are the lead actresses. This one is downright silly at times, but it works on that level. The plot works like a D&amp;D adventure run by junior high school kids... simplistic, full of action and treasure, but gratifying on that really basic level. Perhaps the highlight of this film for many will be the fact that Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen fight on screen for what I believe to be the first time ever.</p><p>I don't really recommend this film to anyone, but there are obviously people out there who will enjoy it. I'm glad I watched it, it was plenty of fun, but in the end it is a throw-away film with a big budget.</p>
80543|twotowers|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-01-01|<p>This was the extended edition of the <short=\"twotowers\" title=\"Two Towers\">movie</a>. This edition adds to the film, and puts in some elements that were removed from the theatrical release, such as Merry and Pippin's consumption of the Ent wine. This only improves my opinion of the film, and of course anyone who didn't see the films in the theater should watch this extended edition.</p>
80544|returnoftheking|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-01-02|<p>This was the extended edition of the <short=\"returnoftheking\" title=\"The Return of the King\">movie</a>. A second viewing of this film has only improved my opinion of it. The extra bits add to the film, and clear up some holes which may have confused people who hadn't read the books.</p>
80545|gardenstate|DVD at girlfriend's parents' house|2005-01-08|<p>Andrew Largeman hasn't been back to his hometown in New Jersey since high school. Most of the time in between has been spent numb on the number of psychoactive drugs he's been prescribed. When his mother dies, he returns for the funeral. He runs into a high-school friend, Mark, and begins to reacquaint himself with old friend while avoiding his overbearing father. At the doctor's office, he runs into Sam, a young woman prone to lying but also with a great spark for life that Andrew seems to have lost.</p><p>This film has everything... well, sorta. No explosions, but it has humor, romance, good characters, and a great story. There were scenes which had my sides hurting, I laughed so hard. So many parts of the film are refreshingly unique and unexpected. In the end it is a coming-of-age story that's worth the trip. On top of all this is a soundtrack that complements the movie immensely.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to everyone. Given the age of the characters, the film's obvious appeal is to a crowd in their twenties or early thirties, but I think many people could appreciate it.</p>
80546|touchingthevoid|TV at girlfriend's parents' house|2005-01-16|<p>In 1985, two British climbers traveled to Peru to climb up the west face of Siula Grande. Joe and Simon make it to the peak, but on the descent Joe breaks his leg. This leads to a situation where Simon decides to cut the rope or be  dragged to his own death.</p><p>I knew of the events of this movie through discussions with any number of people in the <strong>Sierra Club</strong> who had read the book or seen the movie. Not being all that interested in climbing, I wasn't sure I'd ever see this film. But, when they showed it on PBS while we were flipping through channels, it turned out to be as alluring a movie as everyone had said. It doesn't matter if you know what happens, it is the descriptions of the people involved and the dramatic re-enactment that keep you watching. It is amazing what people will do when driven by the will to live.</p><p>This is an impressive and moving film. I wouldn't tell anyone who isn't into climbing to see this film, but anyone would enjoy it, no matter what their interest in the activity.</p>
80547|bestinshow|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-01-21|<p>This mockumentary follows a number of individuals destined for the Mayflower dog show. A poor couple from Florida travels to show their terrier. The young wife of a rich, old man and her trainer hope to take the Best in Show award for the third straight year with their poodle. A neurotic lawyer couple have to overcome their own problems before presenting their dog. A southern man also obsessed with fishing and ventriloquism is bringing his blood hound. And, a gay couple have traveled to present their toy dog.</p><p>It may be worthwhile to watch a dog show on TV before watching this film. I caught one last year, and the similarity between this film and the real thing is rather disturbing. Much of the film seems patently absurd, but so much of what is mixed in is actually what these shows are like. As you shift from personality to personality, the humor works out on any number of levels.</p><p>This is a fairly funny film, and one many people will enjoy. It is in the vein of <strong>Spinal Tap</strong> with a bit more maturity.</p>
80548|beforesunrise|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-01-22|<p>Jesse is traveling to Vienna, where he is catching a plane back to the U.S. the next day. He meets and begins talking to Celine, a French woman about the same age who has spent time in the U.S. and speaks English fluently. Jesse convinces Celine to get off the train with him in Vienna, spending the night together until he has to leave the next day. Knowing this situation, their conversations quickly become candid as they explore the Austrian city.</p><p>I'd never heard of this film until the <short=\"beforesunset\" title=\"Before Sunset\">sequel</short> came out last year. I read several articles that intrigued me, but I was determined not to watch the pair of films solo. The film is an hour and a half of dialogue - anyone else speaking in the film is purely a distraction or prop for the dialogue. They end up discussing a number of topics that will surely be on interest to anyone who considers the notion of falling in love and relationships. It ends up romantic and funny. On top of everything are stellar performances by the two stars.</p><p>I would definitely recommend this film to other people. It is a thought-provoking romance that should be watched with someone else.</p>
80549|skyblue|Korean Cultural Center|2005-01-27|<p>Jay works security for the city of Ecoban, the sole haven for the wealthy in a future that is utterly devastated by environmental damage. Tugging at her heartstrings is a concern for the common man who must choke and die so that the citizens (i.e., not them) of Ecoban can live well. Shua breaks into Ecoban and hacks the computer, retrieving data that will allow him and his mentor to destroy the city, thus saving the workers who are poisoned by its output. When Jay discovers that this childhood friend of hers is still alive, her allegiances begin to waver. But other forces are working to stop Shua and his plans.</p><p>The animation of this film is beautiful, and something that should be watched on a screen that can do it some justice. The story itself is entertaining. That's where I stop saying good things about this movie. The English voice acting was horrible, detracting from the believability of the script, which wasn't all that great to begin with. I'm not sure how much of this is due to the translation and how much was in the original. There are some serious inconsistencies in the film that will stick out like a sore thumb to anyone watching. And of course, the plot moves in some heavy-handed, unnatural ways.</p><p>This movie is mostly for anime fans. It does have a positive environmental message, as well as an above-average view of the working man (but still not giving them voice or power). Most people won't want to bother with this film, though.</p>
80550|beforesunset|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-01-28|<p>Nine years after <short=\"beforesunrise\" title=\"Before Sunrise\">meeting</short>, Jesse and Celine cross paths again when Jesse is in Paris for a book signing of his bestseller. They set off across the streets of Paris with the deadline of Jesse's flight back to the states looming overhead. But also on the agenda, besides why they didn't meet before, are such things as Jesse's wife and son.</p><p>Like the first film, this is pure dialogue. This time around, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy co-wrote the script with Linklater, and the effort that everyone put it shows. The conversation stays funny and enlightening, and rarely strains to feel realistic and natural. Because this film builds upon the previous film, that makes everything much richer. And, in my opinion, this film ends even better than the first.</p><p>I recommend watching both films. Obviously, if you haven't seen the first film, this one is going to be a bit confusing and just not have the pay-off that it should. Highly recommended.</p>
80551|nationoflaw|Video at UCLA|2005-02-02|<p>The first half of this documentary covers the rise and fall of the Black Panther Party. After looking at the kinds of lunch programs that the group started for their communities, it then looks at the government repression against this \"most dangerous\" group. In particular, we get the details of the government assassination of Fred Hampton. Next the movie goes on to the Attica prison uprising, where inmates of several races - though mostly black and hispanic - take over the prison and demand certain human decencies be met. After negotiations, the state raids and kills many, including several guards.</p><p>This is a great documentary. Unfortunately, I've only seen about three or four of the episodes (I believe there are more than 20). This particular episode covers an important group and an important time period, which really shows how far we have sunk in 2005. It also shows to what extent the government is willing to go to keep people from fighting for their \"rights.\" Hidden behind the events is also the reality of what we need to organize looking into the future.</p><p>This is required viewing for any student and any U.S. citizen. Preferably, people could watch the entire series, but until that happens, this is one of the ones to watch first (they are in order chronologically, but this is near the end).</p>
80552|bartonfink|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-02-03|<p>Barton Fink is given a contract to write for Hollywood, following his success with writing for the stage on Broadway. The time period is 1941. Staying in a run-down hotel in Los Angeles, Barton soon becomes \"friends\" with his neighbor. Meanwhile, he is facing some serious writers' block on his first project. He meets up with a famous writer and seeks his help, but ends up falling for the man's tragic lover/ghostwriter.</p><p>This is a truly bizarre film which isn't the least bit uplifting. John Goodman's character ends up being the most interesting. Barton himself isn't all that likeable - if nothing else simply because he doesn't listen to anyone. There are definitely several levels of meaning and criticism in the film, but they may not be worth sorting out.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film. I tend to like Coen brother films, but this one didn't excite me.</p>
80553|ongbak|The Bridge, Howard Hughes Plaza|2005-02-21|<p>When the head of an Ong-Bak statue is stolen from a small Thai village, Ting volunteers to set off for Bangkok to track down the man who stole it. In Bangkok, he meets up with a village expatriate and cousin, George, and George's friend Muay. George, an inveterate gambler, first takes all the villagers' money, then does his best to make money off of Ting's fighting skills. Eventually, though, Ting starts to gather leads on the man who stole Ong-Bak and the boss behind him who is out to profit off of many of Thailand's national treasures.</p><p>Well, the plot is simple and straightforward, but that's just an excuse to watch Tony Jaa kick some serious ass. This man is utterly amazing, and I will very likely be purchasing this on DVD once it is available with English subtitles. Kudos have to go out to all the other fighters and stuntmen as well, as they take some absolutely brutal attacks that no American stuntman would even think about doing.</p><p>If you like to watch seriously great martial art action, then this film is a must-watch for you. This is far and away the best martial arts to be put on film in years.</p>
80554|mariafullofgrace|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-02-23|<p>Maria first finds out she is pregnant from a boyfriend who she doesn't really love yet. Then she quits her sweatshop jobs when the boss punishes her for her morning sickness. When the opportunity arises to make some decent money as a drug mule, she takes the job. A woman who has made the trip twice already shows her the ropes, and soon she is on the way to New York. But when one mule is arrested and another dies, she flees, afraid for her and her friend's lives.</p><p>This is an amazing film. The acting is superb, and the story flows in a manner that doesn't make you feel like you are being abused. The situations are realistic, and you get some insight into why someone would do this, what kind of people they are, and what it is like to do it. The film is cinematic, but few films bother to deal with such serious realities as this.</p><p>I highly recommend this film. The sympathetic character are a great door into a world that most people in this country aren't even aware of.</p>
80555|whalerider|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-02-25|<p>When the chief's newborn grandson and daughter-in-law die in childbirth, his hopes of having a new chief seem squashed. But the twin sister, Paikea, survives. She grows up with her grandparents, and slowly the grandfather grows to love the child, but still does not accept her as a potential for chief, since she is female. But Paikea is a gifted girl and tries her hardest to learn the traditions and ceremonies that a young Maori needs to know.</p><p>This is a heartwarming story about tradition and how it can move forward into the future without sacrificing what is fundamental. The characters are endearing and believable, with Paikea and the grandmother being the two most likeable characters. There is growth and conflict that you see coming, but the storytelling is done so well that this isn't a problem at all. The young girl who plays Paikea does an excellent job as well.</p><p>I would recommend this film to most. It is certainly a tale that beats most of what Hollywood has to offer.</p>
80556|godsmustbecrazy|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-02-26|<p>A small tribe of bushmen in the Kalahari have their lives disrupted when a Coke bottle is dropped from an airplane. Deciding to rid the tribe of this curse, Xixo sets off to throw the bottle off the end of the world. In the meantime, a South African decides to quite her journalism job and work as a teacher in Botswana. The bumbling man who picks her up from the train station does his best to impress her, but vehicle and other problems keep getting in the way. And then there are the rebels from another country who flee to Botswana after assassinating most of their president's cabinet. All three groups slowly converge.</p><p>This is a great slapstick film. The innocence of N!xau's character adds the fundamental charm that made this film an international favorite. The story is absurd, but you don't care. One warning is that the film starts off with a documentary feel. Unfortunately, the story told about the bushmen is nearly entirely fabricated. If you are able to watch this on DVD, there are some shorts in the extra which explore the bushmen in more detail.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to anyone looking for a lighthearted, enjoyable film. If you are bothered by a lack of realism, though, steer clear.</p>
80557|benditlikebeckham|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-03-01|<p>Jess is the British child of traditional Sikh parents. They don't approve of her playing football (soccer) for any number of reasons. But then she meets Jules, who invites her to join an actual team. Having to play on the sly, she tries her best to get the equipment and training time she needs while still keeping the whole adventure secret from her parents. With an older sister engaged and looking to marry, there are more than enough pressures to make it all more difficult.</p><p>This is a delightful and fun story. The writing is sharp and the story keeps you interested. There isn't much doubt about how everything is going to turn out, but the storytelling is good and the jokes consistent, keeping your attention throughout. My girlfriend liked the movie so much after this, her second viewing, that she went out and bought the DVD.</p><p>I would definitely recommend this film. It will appeal to those who appreciate British humor, as well as to those interested in the immigrant experience a generation on.</p>
80558|runlolarun|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-03-10|<p>Manni calls Lola in a panic. He's managed to lose a large sum of money, and unless she can get it to him in the next 20 minutes, he is going to be killed. Lola sets off to see her father, who should be able to cough up the money given his position in the bank he works at. But there are always little kinks along the way. The story is retold three times, each time with a different outcome, not just for Lola and Manni, but for the people she comes in contact with along the way.</p><p>This is certainly an MTV-generation film. The editing is hip and runs off in stylistic tangents from time to time. It isn't exactly consistent between the three different editions, but then I guess the director was assuming the viewer wouldn't care. The story is rather simple, and if you somehow come to care for the characters, you might like it a lot. What they are really shooting for here is the stylish concept and editing... and perhaps a message about how very simple things can have a much bigger effect.</p><p>I'm not sure this is really worth watching, except perhaps from a cinema history point of view. Although this is a recent film, it has already been influential and will certainly have films referring to it, if only loosely, for a few more years to come.</p>
80559|spellbound|DVD at home|2005-03-13|<p>I'd seen this <short=\"spellbound\" title=\"Spellbound\">movie</a> already, but my girlfriend has gotten it through Netflix. It was a good movie, so I wasn't adverse to watching it again.</p>
80560|saved|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-03-23|<p>Mary is about to be a senior at the local Christian high school. At the end of the summer, though, her boyfriend reveals that he thinks he is gay. In an effort to help him from this evil notion, she decides to seduce him to regain his heterosexuality. It doesn't work, but Mary ends up pregnant. Most of the people at her school are complete ignorant, though, and few notice until it is time to give birth. The effect this has on Mary, though, drives a wedge between her and Hilary Faye, the most popular girl at the school.</p><p>I'd avoided this film because of the obvious religious nature of it. In the end, it is still a Christian film, which is simply advocating a more tolerant xity versus the blind fundamentalism everyone starts off with. The redeeming quality of this film is the comedy. There are pretty solid and consistent jokes up till near the end (when we lapse into climax and resolution without much humor). In particular, the humor that comes out of the wheelchair-bound brother and the Jewish girl keep things rather interesting. The pipe bomb line was my favorite in the whole movie.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, really. It is funny, but this is simply an effective vehicle for getting the point across. I don't regret having watched it, but you should have a healthy understanding of religions before stepping in.</p>
80561|warriorsofheavenandearth|DVD at friend's house|2005-03-26|<p>In the early part of the Tang dynasty, a Japanese man sent to China to learn their ways of warfare and government is bound to track down a criminal before he will be allowed to return home. That criminal, guilty of not carrying out orders to slaughter innocent women and children, manages to get himself attached as the protector of a caravan transporting a Buddhist artifact, since the original protectors are almost all dead. When the rival Turks find out about the artifact, they want to capture the caravan for themselves, so our Japanese warrior and the exile criminal must team up to defend the interests of China.</p><p>I watched this film to the end, but I'm not sure why. There weren't any characters that really motivated me, and Zhao Wei's character does next to nothing but narrate. I was struck by how similar this film seemed to <short=\"musa\" title=\"Musa\">Musa</a>, where a bunch of Koreans trapped in China carry out a suicide mission in hopes that it will win their return to their homeland. The final message is a pro-Chinese one, and not one like <short=\"hero\" title=\"Hero\">Hero</a> that is more open to a positive, general interpretation. The fighting in this film is fairly flat, leaving us without the one aspect we might have hoped for. You don't get the stylish hand-to-hand combat, but neither does the combat achieve any goal except to establish that the groups have fought and some have died. I think the more annoying aspect of this is that the three main fighters are presented as if you are going to get a mano-y-mano showdown that never materializes.</p><p>Don't bother watching this film. I wouldn't even recommend <short=\"musa\" title=\"Musa\">Musa</a>, which I thought was a better film (despite a much more annoying lead female), so this one doesn't stand a chance. Sometimes there are interesting historical elements, but much of it is fantasized as well.</p>
80562|notorious|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-03-27|<p>Alicia Huberman's father has just be found guilty of cooperating with the NAZIs. She wants to stay away from it all, but then is approached by agent Devlin. Although they start to fall in love, he also wants her to use her connections through her father to help them track down NAZIs still operating in South America. They put her back in touch with Alex Sebastian, a man who is both important in the NAZIs' efforts and also a former love interest of Alicia. As the U.S. government is learning more through Alicia, she is also drawn into marriage to Mr. Sebastian.</p><p>This was a fairly interesting film -- not your typical Hitchcock film, but still showing that style that he was a master at. The love between Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant is so well done, something that is partly due to an excellent script and partly due to two masters of their craft. The story itself remains fascinating, and you are definitely curious to see exactly where things are going to lead.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to most. I'm definitely of the opinion that scripts were much better up through the 40s and 50s, and this film definitely lives up to that. It is refreshing to watch compared to today's films.</p>
80563|cityofgod|DVD at home|2005-03-29|<p>Rocker lives in \"the City of God,\" a favela of Rio de Janeiro. Growing up in the sixties, he avoids the crime and gang life that nearly all of his friends turn to. As a young boy, he sees his brother and his brother's friends succumb to the dangers of the police. But times are changing, and by the seventies, his classmates Li'l Z&#233; and Benny are running the local drug trade and keeping crime down to a minimum when not needed for their trade. But when conflict between Li'l Z&#233; and rival Carrot break out into all-out war, the ghettos of Brazil will never be the same.</p><p>This was a great movie, and I didn't realize that it was based upon a true story until the end. It does chronicle the evolution of the ghettos in Brazil from the sixties to what we have today. We see the small-time crimes of punks get pushed aside by the big money trade of cocaine. The movie is well acted, and I'm not sure if any actual people from the streets were used in the filming, although some of the script was definitely pulled from archival sources. My ownly complaint about the film is that it is sometimes a bit too busy - the camera techniques and subtitles work against those of us who do not speak Portuguese to cause confusion here and there.</p><p>Also of note on the DVD is a short documentary entitled, \"News from a Personal War.\" This is must-see stuff. We get the point of view of people living in the ghettos, gang members old and young, police, and even the Chief of Police of Rio. The Police Chief is very frank and understands clearly the class warfare nature of his job, which is quite refreshing. I also enjoyed the perspective of the locals, who see more advantages to having the gangs there than they see disadvantages, although this certainly has its limits.</p><p>I would recommend this film to everyone. The only downside is that you need to set aside a good three-and-a-half hours to watch everything -- the movie and the documentary. It is well worth it though.</p>
80564|gunnerpalace|Laemmle Fairfax Cinemas|2005-03-31|<p>Several months after the official declaration of the end of combat operations in Iraq, the 2/3 Field Artillery unit, known as \"Gunners,\" are still struggling to stay alive in Baghdad. They live in the bombed-out palace of Saddam's son, Uday. The soldiers reveal their experiences and impressions, sometimes in words, sometimes in music, and sometime in rap. The cameraman also rides along with them on several raids and missions. After leaving the country, the cameraman learns of the death of one of the soldiers, and decides to head back to Iraq for another period of filming.</p><p>The power of this film is that it gives the perspective of the fighting man at the bottom without any real political spin or bias. What we get in the end is a view of what is really going on on the ground in Iraq today and the way that the soldiers who have to fight there deal with and view it. Because the clips span a time of nearly a year, we also get to see a bit of evolution to events. For all those people in this country who cannot understand why someone would join the military and then continue to fight despite the conditions, this movie will help you understand.</p><p>I certainly recommend this film. It helps to know a little bit more about the war going in, since the film doesn't attempt too much background, but otherwise there's nothing that should stop you from watching it.</p>
80565|aclassdivided|Video at home|2005-04-03|<p>In 1970, the documentary \"Eye of the Storm\" followed a third-grade elementary school teacher, Jane Elliot, as she taught her students in discrimination. The small town of Riceville, Iowa was (and still is) all white and christian. Over the course of two days, the students are divided into groups of blue eyes and brown eyes. Each day has one group dominant over the other. Years later, we catch up with the students and how this experience has affected their lives. We also see the effect the original film has had on education and other parts of public life. We also get to see Jane Elliot apply the technique to adults who work at an Iowa correctional facility, with interestingly similar results.</p><p>There are some amazing things in this documentary. First, just to see how quick and easily discrimination takes root and has an effect on people. This is not only in the elementary school kids, but also in the adults at the correctional facility. The refreshing thing was to see how many people really did learn from the experience. All the kids when interviewed as adults distinctly remember the experience as positive, and they strive to put those lessons into practice in their lives and in the way they teach their children. With the exception of one belligerent woman, the adult participants seemed to have gained much as well. This actually showed that although adults can have some strong refusal-to-learn skills (c.f. the woman), most of them are still open to what the world is about. The real shame of all this is the sense that if someone tried this today, in the year 2005, they would get sued quicker than anything. But then we now live in a society which refused to teach children anything but mythology, while many of us passively do little about it.</p><p>For anyone interested in education, discrimination, or just social interaction in general, this is definitely worth watching. I found it at the local library here in Los Angeles.</p>
80566|kungfuhustle|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-04-06|<p>Sing would love to be part of the powerful Axe Gang, but when he attempts to muscle his way into a poor community he finds things more difficult that he expected. Several local residents are kung fu masters in hiding. His actions, however, bring in the real Axe Gang, and when they are unable to exact revenge upon the community, they outsource to the best killers in the country.</p><p>I'm a big Stephen Chow fan, and I bought this movie on DVD without having yet seen it, assured that I would not be disappointed. Of course I wasn't. The numerous references are excellent, as are the special effects used to animate much of the kung fu powers. This isn't a film you watch for the amazing human skills of fighting, but for the sheer visual pleasure of it. As always, Chow keeps it funny with humor on any number of levels, though I have to say that the slapstick elements are the ones that had me laughing the hardest. </p><p>If you are already a Chow fan, then you don't need me to tell you to watch this film. If you aren't, this is a great entryway into his works. Understanding Chinese culture can help you get some of the humor, but it won't hold you back.</p>
80567|murielswedding|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-04-07|<p>Muriel has grown up with one overwhelming desire, to get married. She sees it as the only way she can \"make it\" and be the kind of person everyone around her will envy. After being rejected by the very \"friends\" she is hoping to impress, she runs into an old high school classmate who helps her learn something else about life. But then there still is that obsession with a wedding.</p><p>This is a pretty funny film that makes fun of that institution which surely needs to be made fun of. The down side to the film is that most of the other characters are quite depressing, Muriel's family in particular. There are also a couple plot elements that just don't make any sense -- they move the story along, but not in a manner that doesn't jar the viewer.</p><p>If this film has caught your eye, then you will probably enjoy it. Although funny, there isn't anything particular about it that makes me want to encourage other people to go out and watch it.</p>
80568|goodbyelenin|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-04-10|<p>Following the escape of their father into West Germany, Alex's mother devotes her life to being a good Party member. Alex loves his mother, and when she has a heart attack and goes into a coma, he is at her side nearly every moment. It doesn't hurt, though, that the attractive Lara is one of the nurses assisting. When mother wakes up, the doctor says she should not be exposed to anything too shocking... the problem is that the Berlin Wall has fallen since she went into a coma and the whole of East German society is in flux. With the help of his friend Denis, who is a whiz at video editing, he does what he can to keep his mother from finding out the truth.</p><p>Although there are heavy elements to this film that have a depressing undertone, the thrust of the film is still quite good. Must of the film is quite humorous, and there is a strong element of social commentary. In particular, we see what has happened to a divided Germany and how the East Germans are dealing with the reunification. Although there are advantages to the new opportunities, there are still a number of elements of the old society that many would prefer to keep.</p><p>I would definitely recommend this film to others, mostly because of its excellent blend of social commentary with humor. There are some surprising elements to it that add to the mix as well.</p>
80569|henryandjune|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-04-14|<p>Ana&#239;s Nin is an author living in Paris, 1931. Her wealthy husband supports her endeavors with a lucrative bank job. But Ana&#239;s wants to meet lively people to inspire her art. Along comes Henry Miller. He exudes a raw, sexual energy that is fresh to Ana&#239;s. Soon, enter Henry's wife June and there is yet another dynamic into the mix, though she only stays in Paris a short while before returning to the U.S. Before we know it, Ana&#239;s is screwing Henry, as well as a few more fellows along the way.</p><p>The story is based upon the diaries that Ana&#239;s Nin kept, held from publication until the death of all the involved parties (I believe Hugo, her husband, was the last to go). The movie runs through the lives of Ana&#239;s and Henry while they both work on their novels, Henry finishing <strong>Tropic of Cancer</strong> near the end of the film. The main focus here is on their interpersonal relationships and the eroticism both authors explored. Not surprisingly, like art students who think they are cutting edge and free, they delve into sexual relations with one another, thinking that they can love and have sex with anyone without bounds. Truth is, of course, that everyone exudes a juvenile nature and does not escape the jealousies their actions  inspire. The acting is quite well done, from the base interests of Henry to the short-sighted desires of Hugo. Everyone does a good job, in my opinion, of showing how truly shallow each of the characters are. Oddly enough, for a film rated NC-17 (for language, I guess, since the sex isn't particularly graphic), I was not really titillated. I think this was because of the shear dispassion the characters inspired in me.</p><p>I don't recommend this film. It is well crafted, but I'm sure there are any number of Hollywood films that are also well crafted but not worth watching. Perhaps the historical significance of these authors is in their exploration of the erotic, but it isn't something that really needs to be seen on screen.</p>
80570|akaruimirai|DVD at home|2005-05-26|<p>Nimura is rather quiet while his friend Mamoru is more outgoing. They both work at an oshibori factory, where their boss is overbearing and imposing. Mamoru has been keeping a poisonous jellyfish that he is slowly acclimatizing to fresh water. When Mamoru knows he is going to be out of the picture, he gets Nimura to continue raising the jellyfish. Mamoru's father then comes into the picture, developing a relationship with Nimura.</p><p>This is a bizarre film that is hard to describe. At no point did it motivate me or involve me emotionally, but I think that was what the director wants, in part. To the best I can figure, this is a film about the disaffected twenty-somethings of Japan today. There are any number of films out of Japan in the last several years which attack the same subject matter, each in a slightly different way. The end result is a quirky film that I don't fully understand, and don't think I'd ever fully understand. There is certainly a hostility toward the rest of society, and a desire to destroy it and perhaps remake Japan anew (but without people?). Beyond that, you'd have to do the interpreting yourself.</p><p>I cannot recommend the film. The acting is decent and the digital shots nice, but I was left utterly baffled. I didn't feel any kind of connection with the characters, and I didn't feel I learned anything. My only question is whether or not the whole jellyfish scheme would work - I highly doubt it.</p>
80571|unleashed|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2005-05-27|<p>Danny has been raised as a dog by Bart, a loan shark in Edinburgh (I didn't hear any Scottish accents in the whole film). When someone doesn't want to pay Bart on time, he sics his dog on them, having trained Danny to fight better than anyone can handle. But Danny's brain is easily distracted and he meets a blind piano tuner named Sam. When it looks like Bart has died, Danny seeks out Sam, who  lives with his step-daughter Victoria, who attends a music school. But when it turns out that Bart isn't dead, Danny has to figure out how to reconcile his master with his new family.</p><p>Despite a series of bad U.S. releases as of late for Jet Li, it was still highly likely that I would go and see this film. And then I started hearing fairly positive reviews, which is kind of odd for a film like this. It got released while I was out of the country, but fortunately it was still in theaters when I got back. The story is fairly innovative, pulling in some new concepts and avoiding a few cliches that seems dangerously obvious. The fighting was quite a pleasure to watch, though the attempts to make Li's fighting style in the film a bit more raw and brutal were hampered by the fact that Li is so highly trained. The characters in this film were also enjoyable, particularly Bart.</p><p>If you are a Jet Li fan who has been burnt by his other \"western\" films, then I'd say it is time to try him out again. It doesn't match up to some of his Hong Kong releases, but it is definitely one of his best non-Chinese films to date.</p>
80572|hitchhikersguide|AMC Santa Monica 7|2005-05-28|<p>Arthur Dent wakes up to find his home is about to be demolished. When his friend Ford shows up, it takes a while for Ford to explain that Arthur is right, but the home being destroyed is Earth. The two of them hitch a ride on a Vogon ship just before the planet is demolished to make way for a freeway. Jettisoned from the Vogon ship, the two end up on the Heart of Gold, a ship with an improbability drive, a depressed robot named Marvin, Arthur's last love interests, and the president of the galaxy, who has recently stolen the ship.</p><p>I've read the first book in the trilogy a couple times, though I never did get around to any of the other ones. I'd heard that the film, although flawed in some ways, was still worth watching if you are a fan of Douglas Adams. I have to agree. They do a fairly good job of capturing humor which wasn't highly visual in the first place. The love story aspect gets sappy and detracts from things, but otherwise the story runs well. Everyone does a good job, and I have to give kudos to the casting director for the excellent choices.</p><p>If you are a fan of Adams or even of British humor, I definitely recommend this film. I have friends who didn't like it, but you should be able to sort out which camp you fall into.</p>
80573|liveatthehollywoodbowl|DVD at home|2005-05-29|<p>After the TV series came to an end, the Python group moved on to movies and live performances. This film is a recording a their appearance at the Hollywood Bowl, which appears to have been quite an experience. People everywhere know the lines to the sketches. Some of the sketches are altered a bit, freshening up things and putting sketches in a different order. There's even a bit of audience interaction.</p><p>There really isn't much I can say about this. Monty Python is one of my favorite shows of all time; I own all their movies and the complete TV series on DVD. If you've never managed to see Monty Python, this would be a great place to start. If you don't like this style of humor, then why have you read this far?</p>
80574|episode3|Regal The Avenues Stadium 13|2005-05-30|<p>With the Clone War continuing, the jedi think they have reached a turning point with the death of Count Dooku. But General Grievous continues the fight, as the Sith lord manipulates everything behind the scenes. More and more power is going into the hands of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, and Anakin is torn between the jedi council and his father figure Palpatine. When Padm&#233; turns up pregnant and Anakin's dreams are premonitions of her death, his alliances are tested even further.</p><p>I wasn't even sure I would see this film. I definitely planned to wait until I'd gathered enough reviews from friends, after the utter disappointment of the previous two movies. Lucas can do special effects and can come up with some good ideas, but his is NOT a director and shouldn't be allowed anywhere near dialogue. This film lived up to my expectations, which were quite low. I did enjoy the special effects. Much of the fighting was well done, though I was disappointed that the Obi Wan vs. Grievous match-up didn't go a little better. The light saber action was definitely too fast at times. The political development in this film is also excellent, although the dialogue and time constraints of the film detract from it. Everything else was painful. The supposed love scenes between Anakin and Padm&#233; had us laughing out loud. And the whole set-up for Anakin's conversion to the dark side was just lame, and not simply because Hayden Christensen is not an actor.</p><p>Well, you don't go to watch this film unless you've seen the other five. If, like me, you felt a need to complete the series, you've already seen it. If not, then why would you even consider watching this film. Maybe after Lucas dies the rights will pass to someone who doesn't have bat shit for brains and will try to fix things... but I don't think that's really possible.</p>
80575|liveataspen|DVD at home|2005-06-01|<p>This is mostly a clip show, pulling together a retrospective of Monty Python's work over the previous 29 years and bringing the surviving cast out on stage for a group interview. It was the first time the troupe had been together is more than a decade, I believe. For fans, the only real value to this is the interview, which is funny and enlightening on a few details. I will probably never watch this again, the way that I certainly will the other films, but I at least got a little out of it that I didn't know before.</p>
80576|killemall|Video at UCLA|2005-06-01|<p>This BBC <strong>Timewatch</strong> documentary goes into the atrocities uncovered by AP reports in 1999, in particular the events at No Gun Ri. It includes interviews with men who were actually there with the U.S. Army as well as survivors who have been scarred physically and mentally by what happened. Despite a Pentagon investigation which tries to whitewash the incident, the documentary shows clearly that it was U.S. policy to attack civilians. Survivors and participants in other incidents also recall their experiences.</p><p>Not the best documentary, it still covers some important issues. Although they do not discuss the direct targeting of civilians in other wars (Germany, Japan, Viet Nam, and so on), we still see quite clearly the mentality of the U.S. government when carrying out any war. It is sometimes difficult to listen to the experiences of the people involved, because of the horror they have to  relate.</p><p>This would be hard to get hold of, and not worth spending time tracking down, but if you have access to it or see that it is playing on public television, I would recommend watching it. The U.S. continues to carry out the same policies today, destroying entire cities like Falluja in the name of \"liberation\" but in fact in order to dominate and control the world.</p>
80577|sirnosir|Directors Guild of America|2005-06-23|<p>This documentary brings to life the history of those soldiers who stood against the Viet Nam War, despite the consequences. From an early stage, enlisted men and women are refusing to aid in the aggression against Viet Nam. Underground newspapers spread throughout the military bases in the U.S. This leads to the combat soldiers refusing to fight, even fragging their officers when those officers attempt to send them on suicide missions in a war where combat troops are supposed to be a thing of the past. As a final blow to the soldiers who resisted the war, the government and the media have recast their experience with the urban legend of the soldier who is spit on when he returns to the states (something that no evidence has yet proven to have actually occurred).</p><p>This is the kind of documentary we need more of. Certainly it wasn't perfect, but it does provide a great deal of information that isn't widely available or known. Besides that, it also presents it in a fairly watchable manner, not in the stodgy manner of so many documentaries out there. It provides an excellent introduction into what some soldiers were doing during that war, and hopefully will open people's eyes to what is possible with the current wars. In the discussion after the screening, one of the veterans brought up the fact that the bulk of the organizers during the Viet Nam War were actually those who had enlisted, not been drafted, since they were the ones who felt most betrayed by what their country was having them do.</p><p>Hopefully this film will get a wider distribution soon. The best thing would be for this film to be distributed to every soldier currently involved in one of the U.S.'s current adventures. If you get a chance to see this, on screen or on DVD, don't pass it by.</p>
80578|batmanbegins|Regal The Avenues Stadium 13|2005-06-24|<p>The death of his father and mother at the hands of a mugger leaves Bruce Wayne the sole living heir to one of the greatest fortunes on the planet. Harboring a need for vengeance that gets usurped, Bruce disappears, looking to get to know the underworld that consumed his parents. Bruce is taken in by the League of Shadows, trained in the arts of the ninja so that he might live up to his full potential. Returning to Gotham, Bruce takes on the persona of Batman, aided by his loyal butler, Albert. He is able to take down the city's known crime boss, but that is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>As many people have said, this is the best Batman movie that has been made, yet. There is only a small amount of suspension of disbelief, and it is done in a reasonable manner. The character development and story are unexpectedly refreshing in a genre that doesn't tend to give you much hope. The only bad acting is from the eye candy. Some have complained about the changes to Bruce from the comic books, but I found many of them welcome; Batman is supposed to be a normal human, but the books have long since made him to be a perfect physical and intellectual specimen. This version brings him down to earth.</p><p>All Batman fans should see the film, and beyond that I think that most people who can enjoy a better than average Hollywood film won't be disappointed. I'm sure I will end up seeing it again.</p>
80579|magnificentseven|DVD at home|2005-07-01|<p>A remake of <short=\"shichinin\" title=\"Shichinin no Samurai\">Seven Samurai</a>, this American western pulls together an impressive cast to rework the story for a small village just south of the border. Plagued by bandits who leave them with next to nothing to live off of, a village finally sends off three men with their gold to fire gunmen to face the bandits when they return for the fall harvest. Out of desperation, honor, or hope, seven men come to the aid of the village. But their help isn't necessarily appreciated by all.</p><p>This version of the story reworks several plot points and characters. Unfortunately, because the movie is compressed into a shorter running time, there isn't much room for the character development and intricacies of the original. Likewise, several of the characters just don't evoke emotion or concern from the audience the way they should before they are riddled with bullets. That being said, they still do a fairly good job of pulling the story together.</p><p>I would recommend that you see <strong>Seven Samurai</strong> first, if you are going to bother seeing this film at all. Since the story here isn't as well-crafted, I would only recommend this film to die-hard fans of westerns.</p>
80580|crash|Pacific Manhattan Village|2005-07-02|<p>The film starts with a black, L.A. detective postulating that people in this city crash into each other just for a chance to feel human contact. As we jump from character to character, each set of people come into contact with others in mostly confrontational ways. This movie is more of a series of vignettes than a single narrative plot. Our first character is a detective with a mother who is an addict and wants to see her other son. Two black car thieves work the streets of L.A. The District Attorney and his pampered wife deal with their problems over race. A veteran cop's racist actions offend his young partner. A black, Hollywood director and his wife deal with racism as the lines of class do not protect them. A Persian shopkeeper buys a gun to protect his small shop, despite his daughters resistance. And a Hispanic locksmith tries to protect his family from the violence of the ghetto.</p><p>Although the vast array of characters seem daunting at first, I really felt the director did a good job of showing enough of everyone that you knew who they were. Most of the characters aren't necessarily likeable, either because of their disgusting attitudes or because of the questionable actions they take. The topic of discussion is definitely race, as the heat of anger leads one character to react or throw out offenses that are racially based. Although the film leans in darker directions from time to time, it pulls back for a ray of hope every now and then as well.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film. It is quite hard to describe it to other people, but I thought it was well done. It is a movie to see with friend and then discuss over coffee afterwards.</p>
80581|lastlife|DVD at home|2005-07-13|<p>Kenji is living in Bangkok, a lonely Japanese ex-patriot who contemplates suicide and ignores the world around him. After his brother shows up, on the lam from yakuza he's betrayed back in Japan, things get thrown into disorder... something Kenji clearly isn't comfortable with. Another suicide attempt is aborted when a young cos-play worker is struck by a car and he helps the sister, Noi, to take her to the hospital. Going home with Noi, he somehow finds a place in her existence.</p><p>This slow-moving film doesn't go into Kenji's reasons, though his brother and hinted-at past certainly must have something to do with it. The relationship that develops between him and Noi is bizarre, to say the least. Initially asexual, the relationship is clearly one of opposites, as we have the contrast of Kenji's meticulously clean and organized apartment to Noi's absolutely run-down and filthy pig sty of a house. When their loneliness collides, it is hard to even figure out most of the time what is going on, where things might be leading. Fantasy scenes help throw the viewer for a loop every so often as well.</p><p>I'm not sure how to recommend this film. There isn't a message or overlying theme that makes me want to recommend it. The acting is good and the camera work excellent, but the movie didn't move me in the end. I also didn't hate it.</p>
80582|dolls|DVD at home|2005-07-22|<p>At the beginning, we see bunraku (Japanese puppetry). For those of you who don't know, the guys without the masks are the masters (and having so many in one play is quite rare). Then we switch to Matsumoto, who has been pressured by his family and employer into marrying the boss's daughter. Problem is that he was secretly engaged to Sawako. When Sawako's attempted suicide fails, Matsumoto jilts his bride-to-be and chains himself (literally and figuratively) to Sawako. We also get the story of a yakuza boss who ditched a loyal girlfriend many years ago, only to find her still holding a torch for him. Then there is the uber-fan, who resorts to self mutilation to continue his adoration of the J-Pop star who has been disfigured.</p><p>The exploration of relationships and their mistakes is the obvious topic here, although everyone's relationship is marred by something really beyond the norm. I cannot honestly say I understood all the intricacies presented; I definitely didn't understand the bunraku play and how it connected exactly. I'm sure the bunraku is a specific one that Japanese would be more likely to know. (I've only seen a few myself and don't remember the stories as much as the performances.) For me, the difficulty of the film was just how clearly these were people at the extremes of human behavior, and hence how little I could relate to their decisions and actions. On a positive side, the cinematography here is compelling, particularly the use of colors. Again, though, some of this is specific to Japanese culture and I'm not sure how well that symbolism translates without explanation.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film. It is not horrible, and I could see why some people with a more artistic flare to their films tastes might like it, but I wouldn't watch it again despite my interest in understanding the symbolism better.</p>
80583|marchofthepenguins|Pacific Manhattan Village|2005-07-23|<p>Once a year, Emperor penguins begin to gather and head towards their breeding grounds, some 70 miles inland. Once there, they begin their courtship until an egg has been produced. With that, the females return to the ocean to feed while the males sit on the eggs until they hatch. Females return with food for the young while males then make the trek back to the ocean to feed themselves, repeating this back and forth trip until the young are ready to fend for themselves. Along the way there are any number of hardships which can bring the whole process to an end.</p><p>The lively and humorous narration of Morgan Freeman keeps the story flowing. Amazing camera shots, not only of the penguins and then habits and interaction, but also of Antarctica keep the viewer amazed. To their credit, they include some clips of the cameramen while the credits are running, answering the nagging question I had through the film of just how exactly they pulled it off.</p><p>It is always nice to see well-crafted documentaries, particularly those that are considered good enough to get wider distribution. If this is something that interests you, then this film will not disappoint. Fun for the whole family.</p>
80584|jackiebrown|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-09-02|<p>Ordell has gotten into gun running and is making quite a lot of money, though it is all stashed away in Mexico. Jackie is a stewardess on the LAX to Cabo San Lucas flight of a budget airline. She is caught by ATF coming back into the country with Ordell's money and a little something else stashed in there for one of Ordell's girls. Introduce Max, the bail bondsman, who Ordell goes though to get Jackie out of jail before she can potentially squeal to the fuzz. Now they have to come up with a plan to get Ordell's money into the country and keep the ATF off their backs.</p><p>Although littered with the excesses that Tarantino is known for, the film is still quite good. The plot is interesting, the characters likeable or distasteful (as needed), and a good amount of humor to keeps things lively although the action and suspense should be enough for that. Pam Grier is great, and the tension between her and Max is quite well done. I have no regrets in having bought this film, as it is in my opinion Tarantino's best straight film.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to anyone who somehow hasn't seen it yet. It isn't as over-the-top violent as Tarantino's other films and keeps to a more traditional storyline, so it probably more approachable to those who would otherwise shy away from his material.</p>
80585|donniedarko|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-09-23|<p>This movie is rapidly climbing up the ladder of films I've seen <short=\"donniedarko\"view=2002-12-24 title=\"Donnie Dark Dec 24 viewing\">multiple</a> <short=\"donniedarko\"view=2002-05-12 title=\"Donnie Darko film review\">times</a>. My girlfriend hadn't seen it yet, and I managed to buy a cheap copy of the original DVD (I've heard about the Director's Cut and have no interest in seeing it). As should be obvious by now, this is a movie I'd recommend for everyone.</p>
80586|comedrinkwithme|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-09-20|<p>When bandits take the son of an administrator captive in order to exchange for their own captive leader, Golden Swallow is sent in to recover him and bring the bandits to justice. Her excellent sword skills make quick work of those who oppose her, but their numbers may be too much. She also needs help gathering information. Drunken Cat, a man who looks to be a local beggar, turns out to be quite helpful at this. But there are more behind the forces of evil than simply a group of brigands.</p><p>I'd heard about this film years ago, but had never been able to secure a copy of it until recently, when I was able to buy it on DVD. It is Region 3, unfortunately, but at least it is in fairly good shape. The fighting in the film is obviously dated, but it is also clear that these guys were setting the standards for later films, inspiring other movie makers to build off of what had taken place here. I saw distinct notes that were used in a number of recent wuxia films. As an added bonus, I believe this is the first film Jackie Chan ever appeared in (though I honestly couldn't spot him among the group of boys in the inn).</p><p>For fans of the wuxia genre, this is a must-see. It does hold up remarkably well with time, a feature attributable in large part to director King Hu.</p>
80587|serenity|Pacific Beach Cities 16|2005-09-30|<p>The crew of the ship Serenity has been having more and more trouble getting paid, with one passenger wanted by the Alliance. And when Mal, the captain, puts River in harm's way, her brother decides to leave the ship with her. But then an incident bring them back together and on the run. Meanwhile, the Alliance has hired a skilled assassin to track River down. To do so, he sets up a trap that the crew cannot avoid.</p><p>Although accessible to anyone, this is really a movie for fans of the <short=\"firefly\">TV series</a>. Knowing the backgrounds on these characters makes the plot that much more interesting. The real drive being this movie is the characters and the dialogue. Much of it is fun, then there is quite a bit that has its tongue firmly planted in the cheek &ndash; the 'romance' scenes in particular.</p><p>I thought the movie was quite fun, though I can say for sure that many will not like it. Really, if you were a fan of the show, you've probably already seen this movie. Otherwise, I would recommend watching an episode or two of the series for a taste of things, watching them in order then if you like them, to cap it all off with the movie, which answers a lot of the unanswered questions of the series.</p>
80588|someonespecial|Korean Cultural Center|2005-09-29|<p>Dong Chi-Seong has just been dumped by his girlfriend. Then he finds out from the doctor that he only has about two or three months left to live. Getting drunk that night, he is taken home by the bartender, Han Yi-Yeon. Although Dong doesn't seem to understand why Han is helping him, he finds himself turning to her because other problems. If you had two months left to live, what would you do with your home, your job, your life?</p><p>I'd heard this was a really off-beat and quirky romantic comedy, and I was truly pleased with what I saw. The comedic timing in this film is excellent. The characters are plain oddballs themselves, especially our female lead. As an added bonus, there is a nice poke at the romantic genre in Korean cinema in the middle of the film. I found myself laughing most of the time, though there were a few stretches when things slowed down a bit. I think these are actually there on purpose, to punctuate the rest of the film, and they didn't drag me down.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to anyone, not just fans of Korean films. Obviously, the poke at Korean cinema is going to be lost on those unfamiliar with it, but the rest of the movie stands on its own. Great date movie.</p>
80589|onceuponatimeinthewest|DVD at home|2005-08-12|<p>Three outlaws wait at a train station for a man to arrive. He's scheduled a meeting with Frank. An Irish man with several kids of his own waits for the arrival of his new wife, but they are attacked before one of the sons can leave to pick her up. Cheyenne breaks free from lawmen set to take him to jail or worse and meets up with the man who'd been set to meet Frank. The wife arrives on the train, but when no one is there to pick her up she has to find a way out to the homestead to find the bodies of her new family.</p><p>I'm not inclined to give away too much of the plot. This is a Western, but it is so much more, and breaks out of the bounds of the bulk of that genre. You don't really know who is who and who is on whose side until late in the game. Mind you, it is a slow, artistic ride to get there, but it is worth it. The film manages to hit what is now one of my favorite movie scenes, when the railroad baron asks Frank what it's like to sit behind his desk. Great stuff.</p><p>If you've seen any of Leone's other stuff, you should already have an appreciation for his work. This one lives up to his high standards. I'd recommend it to anyone, regardless of their tastes in movies.</p>
80590|motorcyclediaries|DVD at girlfriend's parents' house|2005-10-08|<p>Ernesto and Alberto are young Argentinians who are well-off and educated (Ernesto has a semester left to go in medical school), and they want to see South America. They've read about Europe and other parts of the world in school, but they don't really feel they know their own backyard. They set off on an old motorcycle, intending to cross Chile, Peru, and eventually end up in Caracas, where Alberto is planning on working. Along the way, they plan to stop at a leper colony. As they travel, the get to see the seedier side of the world, along with the division and misery that entails.</p><p>This movie has good acting and beautiful scenery to aid it along. A great soundtrack doesn't hurt, as well. The mood is kept lively while still addressing question in a serious manner. We see the evolution of \"Che\" and the experiences that lead to his role in the Cuban revolution.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to other people. It certainly isn't heavy handed or overdone on the political end, and is an interesting story even if you aren't concerned with the social issues at hand.</p>
80591|battlestargalactica|DVD at home|2005-10-07|<p>It has been something like forty years since humans have had contact with the Cylons. Galactica is being retired, turned into a museum. But then the Cylons return and the wipe out nearly all of humanity, save for about 50,000 who manage to survive. The commander of the Galactica becomes the highest ranking military officer remaining, while the Secretary of Education becomes the new President, and everyone has to figure out how to escape from the Cylons so that they can regroup for a fight.</p><p>Co-workers had been talking about this, and although I was a bit too young to see the original show when it ran, I was interested enough to watch this. Since I don't know the original, I cannot comment on any changes or updates to that. As far as sci-fi goes, the film is passable. I didn't see anything all that new introduced that really blew me away. I enjoyed watching the film, but as my friend pointed out, only two of the characters really have any development. Several of the key characters just aren't interesting, though that may change in the full TV series.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't already interested. I'm definitely not motivated to watch the series as a result of seeing this movie, which is essentially the set-up for the TV series.</p>
80592|purplebutterfly|DVD at home|2005-10-19|<p>Ding Hui and Itami have a special relationship, going to school together in a town in China in the 1920s. Then Itami is sent back to Japan. At the same time, Ding Hui's older brother and compatriots are killed by a Japanese man because they are speaking out against Japan's moves against China. Jump forward to 1931, and Ding Hui is now in Shanghai, working with Xie Ming and a group of radical assassins who target Japanese officials in that city. Szeto gets involved when he is mistaken for one of the assassins and his girlfriend is killed. Then Itami returns to China, working for the embassy in Shanghai.</p><p>This is a slow and artistic film, that sometimes sacrifices character development and explanation for a long, melancholy shot. Obviously, the director wanted certain things to only become clearer later in the film, and maybe some of the trouble was in the subtitles (I doubt it), but I often had to strain to figure out who was who. I have to admit, though, that this film is beautiful to watch. The musical accompanyment is right on. And, to her credit, Zhang Zi Yi has made a film that didn't make me hate her... well, I was getting kind of fuzzy on this point near the end, but I think I get it.</p><p>The central message of this film is certainly against the Japanese, but maybe a bit of pondering over how to have gone about it. Certainly, the film's ending leaves no question as to whether or not the Japanese should have been fought, but the film also doesn't look to provide any answers, such as they might be.  All-in-all, I wouldn't recommend this film. I didn't hate it, but I'm not sure that it adds anything that anyone can benefit from.</p>
80593|waikikibrothers|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-10-27|<p>A small band is down on its luck. As they prepare to travel to a gig in a resort town, but during the off-season, one member leaves (and several have already left over the years). Once there, the three remaining members have trouble keeping themselves together, let alone the band. One of the band members meets a woman he'd had a crush on in high school, and now she's a widower.</p><p>I really thought this film was going to be funnier than it was. Mind you, have it's funny points, but for the most part this is a drama &ndash; and a sobering one at that. Without the humor and liveliness there is, it would have been downright depressing. This certainly isn't a happy ever after story in a conventional sense, but it is realistic people coming to terms with themselves and what they want.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, really. When I was at the video store, I had some notion that the film had some good reviews. To me, it was just mediocre.</p>
80594|wererabbit|AMC Avco Cinema|2005-10-29|<p>Wallace and Gromit run a humane pest service, collecting rabbits before they can damage the local crops. This is big business, since their town is also the site of an annual giant vegetable festival. But the duo are being overwhelmed by all the rabbits they are now keeping in their basement. In a bit of an experiment, Wallace tries to replace the rabbits' nature. Soon, the town is in an uproar because a large rabbit is terrorizing their gardens. Even Lady Tottington has called in our heroes to help, but if they cannot resolve the problem in time, Victor Quartermaine &mdash; a suitor of Lady Tottington &mdash; will resort to killing the beast.</p><p>When I first heard of this film, I was already excited. The short films from Nick Park have all been good, and I was pleased with <strong>Chicken Run</strong>. It took me a lot longer to get to the theater on this one than it probably should have, but at least there weren't crowds of kids there. In any case, this film was plenty of fun. My only real complaint is that it cries out for a pause button, since some of the scenes have so much going on. I know I missed any number of subtle jokes going on in the background. Overall, the story line is quite approachable for children, and for the most part the real appeal to an adult sensibility is that there are any number of jokes which are just downright cerebral. That style of British punnery appeals to me, and certainly to any fan of the Wallace & Gromit pieces.</p><p>I'd definitely recommend this one, to kids and adults. For those who have somehow managed to not see the shorts that were done, get your hands on those, as well.</p>
80595|nowhere2hide|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-11-10|<p>The experience of watching this on a TV screen is different from seeing it in the <short=\"nowhere2hide\" view=2000-12-27>theater</a>, thought it still leaves a strong impression. One mistake I caught from my first review: the classical music during the final fight scene is actually the Bee Gees song orchestrated. It is a pleasure to see the lines between cops and villains blur, visually and in the dialogue, leaving one to question the difference. The film does draw a line, though. This is an enjoyable film to anyone who can appreciate the genre, and my previous recommendation still stands.</p>
80596|ongbak|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-11-16|<p>I was seriously impressed when I saw this in the theater the <short=\"ongbak\" view=2005-02-21>first time</a>. On a recent buying spree, I picked up the DVD. To my delight, my girlfriend was interested in watching it, so we popped it in the day I got it. Obviously, the plot here is just an excuse, but it is still impressive to see this guy in action. I'm definitely interested in his next film when it comes out.</p>
80597|charliechocolatefactory|DVD at girlfriend's parents' house|2005-11-26|<p>Charlie Bucket and his family are dirt poor, and we're talking about holes in the roof and nothing to eat poor. But Charlie is a wholesome chap who loves his folks. Once a year, Charlie gets a Willy Wonka chocolate bar for his birthday, but this year there are five golden tickets that are hidden inside random bars. The first four tickets go to kids with the most horrible of vices, but on the last day, Charlie comes up with the fifth ticket. As Mr. Wonka gives the lucky children and their parents a tour of his secretive factory, each kid manages to eliminate themselves.</p><p>I saw the first rendition of this when I was young, but I don't really remember it. I also hadn't read the book since probably the second grade as well. Since seeing the movie, I have read the book. This movie does do a rather good job of updating a few things but sticking to the book. The only real complaints I have are with the introduced side-story for Willy Wonka's childhood and that Johnny Depp plays an incredibly creepy, Michael Jackson-esque Wonka. I really don't think this last is in keeping with the book. But the musical numbers, using the lyrics from the book, are excellent. The production values are high. You cannot but be amazed at the fact that they actually trained squirrels to do this stuff. Using the same guy for all the Oompa Loompas was a nice touch, too. I was pleased to find that the running gag against Mike Teevee was in the book, and we've been known to shout \"mumbler\" at one another since seeing this film.</p><p>I'd recommend this film. It isn't perfect, but it was fun. I'm a big fan of Roald Dahl books; I'm determined to buy a complete set when I have a kid of my own to read them to. One of the ultimate messages of the book, of course, is that kids shouldn't be wasting their life away watching TV or movies, but should remember how to read. Not a bad moral at all, in my opinion.</p>
80598|themyth|DVD at girlfriend's house|2005-12-08|<p>Jack is an archaeologist based in Hong Kong. His old friend, a scientist, shows up and convinces him to head off to some Indian region (Dassar). Meanwhile, Jack is having reoccuring, serial dreams wherein he is a Qi general and he is developing a relationship with a Korean princess who is to become the Chinese emperor's new concubine. In Dassar, they find a picture of this dream princess along with a sword much like the one the general of Jack's dreams had. To boot, they discover a meteorite that somehow leads them to another discover of great importance for Chinese history.</p><p>The plot of this movie is hard to follow at times. Things jump back and forth a bit, and when we get the historical scenes, it sometimes isn't clear what the chronology is in relationship to the last dream. But then there is some really innovative fighting that we'd all expect from Jackie Chan. The fly paper factory is easily the best. One cannot complain about the women in this film either, as gratuitous as some of the scenes are. It was interesting to see Jackie doing some period costume work (you cannot really count all the generic period pieces like <short=\"dm2\">Drunken Master II</a>).</p><p>This is a film for Jackie fans, and I don't think it has much appeal to someone who isn't already into his material. It's good to see him return to Hong Kong to do some movies, since CGIed limitations of Hollywood can get annoying.</p>
80599|closeshave|Video at girlfriend's house|2005-12-11|<p>Wallace and Gromit are running a window cleaning business and the papers are reporting of a sheep rustler. When Wendolene Ramsbottom, who runs a wool and yarn shop, needs her windows cleaned, Wallace is more interested in her than the cleaning, which is left for Gromit to do. But Wendolene's dog is up to something, and soon he has framed Gromit for the sheep rustling.</p><p>This episode, the third of the shorts, shows the refinement of technique that necessarily comes from years of work. The claymation here is tighter and smoother. The story itself is what one expects from Nick Park and his people. The facial expressions on Gromit cannot help but evoke laughter. And the similarities between Wallace and Wendolene's mannerisms are just too cute. It makes it that much more sad at the end when the inevitable happens.</p><p>This stuff is approachable to everyone, and I certainly recommend everyone seeing the episodes as well as the <short=\"wererabbit\" title=\"Curse of the Wererabbit review\">movie</a>. I'll probably buy them on DVD when I get around to it (it is available, right?).</p>
80600|wrongtrousers|Video at home|2005-12-21|<p>Wallace seems to have forgotten Gromit's birthday, but when he does cough up some gifts, they aren't exactly something a dog would want. Then things get worse. Because the two are having trouble paying the bills, Wallace decides to take in a lodger who quickly takes over Gromit's room. As the new live-in, a penguin, ingratiates himself to Wallace, Gromit decides to hit the road. But this penguin has ulterior motives, and they spell trouble for Wallace and his hi-tech trousers.</p><p>The humor is the same, which is to say good, as the other Wallace &amp; Gromit material. In this episode, the penguin makes such a delightful bad guy. His eyes and his expression of delight when he seems to have gotten the better of Gromit are excellent. The animation is clearly cleaned up compared to <short=\"granddayout\" title=\"A Grand Day Out movie review\">A Grand Day Out</a>.</p><p>I'm a fan of Wallace &amp; Gromit, so I definitely recommend this and all their films. This is the second film, chronologically.</p>
80601|granddayout|Video at home|2005-12-21|<p>Wallace and Gromit aren't sure where to spend the bank holiday. As Wallace shuffles through travel magazines and brochures, he gets a little peckish. Seeing that they're out of cheese, the idea dawns upon him to take a trip to someplace that has cheese: the moon. After an interesting construction job, the two are off. On the moon, they picnic and try the cheese that's all around. But there's also a robot there who sets after them once Wallace has fed it 10p.</p><p>This is the first Wallace &amp; Gromit film, and it shows. The characters aren't as refined as they are in the later films, and their movements are a little choppier. Nonetheless, the core of the duo and their interaction is here, making for the same level of humor.</p><p>As with the others, I recommend this one. It is probably a good place to start, that way you build up to the others, which have references back to prior episodes scattered throughout them.</p>
80602|syriana|Mann Bruin Village|2005-12-30|<p>The emir of a Middle Eastern country is about to turn over his country to one of his sons. The older son is Oxford educated and appears to have the genuine interest of his people in mind, and to that end is looking to make a deal with the Chinese to supply them with oil. The younger son is a spoiled playboy, and for that reason easy to manipulate and thus the obvious choice for the U.S. who wishes to retain control over the oil instead of the Chinese. We also have a CIA agent, experienced in the backstreet arms deals and assassinations of Iran, Lebanon, and other Middle Eastern countries. And, as two oil companies look to merge, the smaller one the benefactor in an amazingly (and disproportionately so) lucrative new contract, they are under investigation.</p><p>This is an excellent movie at exploring the oil industry and its relationship to politics in all its dirty glory. The array of characters lets us see into any number of perspectives, from the CIA's role to that of the local nobles to the politicians whose job it is to make sure oil companies keep making their profits without popular objection. For me, one of the best scenes in the movie is when the oil industry analyst character starts ripping into the emir's son, only to be rebuffed with the reality of the U.S. contracts and deals that all the oil-producing countries must sign on to. Then, of course, there's the reality of what the U.S. government is willing to do to its enemies and its friends.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to everyone. It doesn't need to be seen in a theater, and I myself was tempted to wait until it came out on DVD, because the real meat of this film is in its content, not its visuals.</p>
80603|brokeback|United Artists Theater in Marina Del Rey|2006-03-04|<p>Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist meet as young, poor men, both needing the work herding sheep up in the mountains during the summer. The owner of the sheep has them breaking the law and sleeping in two separate locations. But the time alone draws the two together. After the job is over, they go on with their lives, getting married and having kids. But the connection they made that summer won't leave either of them alone.</p><p>If there's one thing Ang Lee excels at, it is creating visually beautiful films. Everyone puts in a pretty good performance, as well. When you get down to brass tacks, this is really just a love story, but it is executed quite well. Along the way, we get some insight into a time period and a life style few of us have any clue about. My only real complaint about the film is that I wanted subtitles. I could understand Heath Ledger enough, but often I found myself wondering exactly what he just said. I wasn't along in this impression. The make-up work on the two main actors once they've aged is also a bit off, but that's forgivable.</p><p>I'd recommend this film, although most who want to see it probably already have, given its Oscars and all. Guess there are still those out there who were waiting for the DVD.</p>
80604|shiri|Video at home|2006-03-10|<p>A friend mentioned this movie and its similarity to <short=\"nikita\">La Femme Nikita</a> to my girlfriend, and since she hadn't seen it, I watched it again. For my previous comments, go <short=\"shiri\">here</a>. I was much more attentive to the plot holes and those elements that were just unreasonable (one a few soldiers guarding the transport of the most deadly weapon in the country?), but it is still an enjoyable flick.</p>
80605|duckyousucker|James Bridge Theater at UCLA|2006-04-12|<p>Juan Miranda is more bandit than rebel, but opportunities abound as the Mexican Revolution unfolds around him. Soon he meets Sean Mallory, an IRA man who has fled to Mexico with his dynamite and explosives to avoid capture by the British authorities for his role in Ireland's revolution. Juan hopes to use Sean's talents to knock over a bank that his father had unsuccessfully taken a crack at years before. Problem is, Sean doesn't seem to want to have anything to do with it. But when they both make their way to the city where the bank is, events thrust them to the forefront of local revolutionary activity.</p><p>I just needed to know that this was a Sergio Leone film, and I was interested in going to see it. This version apparently included some cut scenes that hadn't been shown before in the U.S. (and since I'd never seen it before, I cannot comment on that). The movie was quite fun, though. It has that signature Leone feel, with the twists and turns and many things left unsaid but still presented visually. Also the nice long silences and shots.  The main critique I've heard is about the Spanish and Irish accents that turn on and off throughout the film, but I didn't care so much about this.</p><p>I would recommend this film to Leone fans. I cannot say it was better than <short=\"thegoodthebadandtheugly\">The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</a> or <short=\"onceuponatimeinthewest\">Once Upon A Time in the West</a>, but it is still a fun film.</p>
80606|xmen|DVD at home|2006-04-08|<p>With the <short=\"x3\">third film</a> set to be released soon, my girlfriend wanted to go back and see the other two films, since she only remembered seeing parts of one of them. I don't have much to add from my <short=\"xmen\">previous reviews</a>. I still enjoy the film and am anxiously awaiting the next (but hopefully last) one.</p>
80607|x2|DVD at girlfriend's parents' house|2006-04-22|<p>Just finishing up the rewatching of the first two films before the third one comes out. Check out my <short=\"x2\">previous review</a> for more detailed information.</p>
80608|aboutschmidt|DVD at home|2006-06-29|<p>Schmidt has just retired from a career in insurance. As soon as he's out the door, though, he feels like he's wasted his life. At home he and his wife aren't getting along so well, her not being used to having him around regularly. And then his daughter is set to be married to what looks to be a total loser. When his wife dies, he goes into a complete funk of post-work doubt.</p><p>I haven't see <short=\"sideways\">Sideways</short> yet, but since I'd heard so much about it, I thought it would be worthwhile to watch this film. Besides, it was free to borrow it from the library. I found it rather depressing and uninteresting, though. There is definitely not enough humor to sustain a movie like this. Schmidt is not sympathetic as a character, so if you aren't at all interested in watching his crisis develop, it makes the film that much more of a downer.</p><p>I cannot recommend this film to anyone. If you've made it to the age of 60 or more without really questioning the things Schmidt questions, then you aren't going to be helped by watching this.</p>
80609|banlieue13|NuWilshire Theatre|2006-06-13|<p>It is 2010, and French politicians have given up on the Banlieue &ndash; the disticts in the suburbs of Paris where the poor and working class are concentrated. The banlieue have been walled off and all support services like education and police have been pulled. As a result, the banlieue are run by whichever drug lord is the most powerful there. In number 13, one man stands up to the gangs, and we start the film with him destroying a drug shipment he has intercepted. When they cannot catch him, they kidnap his sister. This eventually leads to his jailing by the police, leaving him in jail until some time later when they need him to assist a police officer on a special mission into his home district. It seems the gang there has managed to steal a neutron bomb, and these two are being sent in to defuse it before it explodes.</p><p>This is a good action film at the very least, with one of the main characters played by a founder of Parkour and the other a decent martial artist in his own right. The fight choreography is quite good, and the fights and chases are a pleasure to watch for action fans. There are plot holes, of course, but if that kind of thing really bothers you with this kind of film, you really should rethink why the hell you are watching it. I actually liked the story and characters. In particular, I was pleased with the political messages that do come across in the film. I also took the ending to be a deliberate deus ex machina to additionally point out the problems of the French state, and not as a simply absurd way to wrap up a film.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to all action fans. The parkour is just amazing to watch, and leads to some interesting fights.</p>
80610|dirtyharry|DVD at Bijou Hotel in San Francisco|2006-05-14|<p>A sniper is holding the city of San Francisco hostage, and Inspector Harry Callahan is the man on the job. Harry doesn't have the best record in the Chief's book, but he does get results. A stakeout gives results, but because of Callahan's methods, the killer is set free and the city cannot press its case. When he strikes again, Harry is pulled from the case. But Harry isn't going to let that stop him.</p><p>I'm sure I saw this as a kid, but I didn't remember any of it. Someone I know had rewatched it recently, inspiring in me a desire to watch it as well. When the hotel I was staying in up in San Francisco said they were showing it, it didn't take much to convince me. I had this notion that the film was going to be more progressive upon second viewing. But in the end, this is the same old film (or maybe this one set the standard?). It is about a cop, \"conistrained\" from acting in the most \"efficient\" manner by a bureaucracy and silly laws. Keep in mind that this film is coming out in 1971, just a few years after Miranda rights and a number of gains of the Civil Rights movement that put limitations upon the brutality of police officers. This is also San Francisco, right next to Oakland, the center of the Black Panther movement which had armed black men following the cops around and reading law books. In this context, the movie is actually quite offensive. I'm a fan of a number of Eastwood films, but his delivery of the signature lines comes across as cheesy as could be, detracting that much more from the film. The bad guy is also just a raving looney who is as equally unbelievable as a character.</p><p>I certainly won't be checking out any more of this series. It is popular cinema, but precisely the kind that seeks to address the most backward elements of society at a time when society was actually making some forward movement. It is hard for me to take it out of this context and turn off my brain just to make it enjoyable.</p>
80611|duelist|DVD in Hotel Room in New York|2006-05-09|<p>Detectives Ahn and Namsoon are working undercover in an open-air market when a masked swordsman kills several men and takes a statue from them. The thief has also managed to create a diversion by dumping bags full of coins among the people gathered about. A chase and a duel ensue between the thief and Namsoon, but he escapes. They do find out, however, that the coins are fake and that someone is flooding the country with the counterfeits. As they track down the culprits, clues seem to be leading to the Minister of Defense.</p><p>I'd read a review of this recently, and while perusing DVDs in New York Chinatown, came across a copy of it fairly cheap (along with a number of other titles). Since I'm traveling, the only way to watch it right now was on my laptop, but that's better than sitting in my hotel room twiddling my thumbs. In any case, it was quite beautifully done. The film is incredibly rich visually, with some scenes exploding with color while other scenes are dark with only a faint hint of white to draw out the important elements. Music adds to the mood, but most definitely keeps it playful &ndash; a rugby-like scene involving a bag of coins plays a traditional (Western) sports tune. The charm, for me, is Namsoon with her funny, comic stances and moves. Oh yeah, and the cinematic fighting between her and the thief who we only get to know as \"Sad Eyes.\" This isn't for fight purist, or even fans of kung-fu films, since most of the motion is dance-like and emotional, rather than techniques that bear any relation to reality. We aren't looking at a complex plot here, and word is that the director wanted the film to be classified as a melodrama.</p><p>I liked the film, not because it tells us anything about ourselves, but because it is simply fun to watch. I could definitely see myself watching this again, though I want to make a point to watch it on the best screen I can so that the visuals truly have a chance to shine.</p>
80612|executionersfromshaolin|DVD on Airplane from Los Angeles to New York|2006-05-08|<p>As the Manchurian government cracks down on the southern Shaolin temple, burning it to the ground, the rebel monks are forced to flee. The master and abbot of the temple is slain by White Eyebrows, a priest and master of a body method that makes him nearly invulnerable. Hong Xiguan, as the most adept of those who escapes, keeps the rest of the monks organized over the years: first in disguise as acting troupes aboard red boats, and then on land after their cover is blown. Along the way, he marries and has a son. He trains in his tiger style in hopes of avenging his master, but refuses to learn his wife's crane style.</p><p>This is one of the classics of kung-fu cinema. Not simply because it tells one of the important stories, but because it does it well.  There is plenty of fighting, and there isn't much time wasted on scenes that would just draw out the film. We often jump years into the future, since this is a tale of slow-brewed revenge and the training it takes to get there. This is, of course, the seventies style of kung fu, where techniques are clear and somewhat paused between each attack to emphasize the styles. The fight scenes are long, but in between the social interaction is mixed with kung fu as well (from wedding nights to raising a child). And, most important of all, White Eyebrows is total bad-ass.</p><p>This is a film for kung fu fanatics, with no real value to anyone else. But if you are a fan of the genre, this is one to own.</p>
80613|harakiri|DVD at home|2006-07-11|<p>In 1630s Japan, a vast number of samurai have gone masterless and wander the countryside as brigands or fill the streets of Edo looking for some way to make ends meet. A ronin, Tsugumo, shows up at the estate of a prominent daimyo in Edo to request the right to commit seppuku in their courtyard. The acting head of the estate tries to turn him away, but when the ronin is persistant, he insists that the ronin first listen to the story of the last ronin who appeared with the same request. Several ronin are reported to have turned up at the doorsteps of different daimyos' estates with the same request to carry out harakiri, only to be offered money so that they might disappear. But the ronin who showed up at their door was forced to commit seppuku under rather horrible conditions. Yet, Tsugumo insists on continuing with the ceremony.</p><p>I wasn't sure what to expect going into this film, but I was extremely pleased. It ends up being a complete condemnation of the samurai system and its code of honor. As an extra commentary on the DVD points out, this critique is that much more powerful because it is at the height of the Tokugawa's power that this is taking place, instead of at the end when many of the samurai films of a similar vein take place. The story is also quite masterfully told. It builds up slowly and will bore those who thought they were watching a standard chambara. There is some fighting, but it is short and to the point near the end. But even this pays off, making it worth the wait.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to just about anyone. Like I said, it isn't an action film, more of an art film, but it is by far one of the best samurai films I've ever seen, on par with <director=\"kurosawa\">Kurosawa's</director> best.</p>
80614|kingkong|Airplane from New York to Los Angeles|2006-05-11|<p>It is the height of the depression, and actress Ann Darrow has just lost her job. Director Carl Denham is having trouble getting further funding for his far fetched movie ideas. When it looks like his backers are going to back out, he scrambles to get his crew on a boat and off shore before the police can arrest him. He has a map to a secret island that is mythically known as Skull Island. When the finally find the island, the find the natives hostile and soon Ann has been kidnapped for sacrifice to Kong. The crew of the ship decide to go after her, but this turns out to be more of an adventure than any of them expected.</p><p>I hadn't really planned to see this film, but since they were showing it on the plane and my laptop battery doesn't last long enough to watch a whole DVD, I plugged in my headphones. There were definitely scenes missing, and sadly I hear from someone else that has seen the full version that some of the most gratifying scenes were cut for the airline version. In any case, it was still a fun movie. The special effects were fairly well done, with the glaring exception of the stampede scene which just didn't look real enough and had a number of problems with continuity and depth. The story, of course, is the one we all know from the original story, unless you somehow don't know about <a href=\"http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/12/05\" title=\"Penny Arcade King Kong cartoon\">it</a>. I mean, much of the reason I wasn't interested in seeing this film in the first place was because of my low regard for remakes.</p><p>The film is as good as I'd expect it to be. I wouldn't watch it again, but it was definitely a fun way to spend a long flight. I've surely seen worse films while in the air.</p>
80615|ladyvengeance|Nuart Theatre|2006-05-20|<p>Geum-Ja is sentenced to 13 years in prison for the kidnapping and slaying of a young boy. She knows she didn't do it, but the rest of Korea is horrified. In prison, she becomes a model prisoner on the surface. But what she is really doing is setting up favors for when she is let free. Then, with their help, she'll track down the man who committed the crime and extract her vengeance.</p><p>Although <short=\"oldboy\">Oldboy</short> has this one beat for the hallway fight scene, there are still a number of things to be satisfied with in this film. There is some excellent cinematography and some unusual sequences. Geum-Ja leaving the prison is also just hilarious and invigorating.  But the best part of the film for me is the resolution. To me, it really does suggest something new about vengeance and what it means to people. On that level, it really does belong at the end of the trilogy.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to anyone whose seen the first two and has an interest in Park's films. They are violent and bloody at times, but there is something more to them than that. I do recommend seeing the other films first, now that I've seen them all, but this isn't a requirement, as they all stand alone.</p>
80616|leon|DVD at home|2006-06-11|<p>My girlfriend had never seen this film, so I had to screen it for her. I've seen it a few times, and you can read my <short=\"leon\">reviews</short> elsewhere.</p>
80617|postconcussion|Korean Cultural Center|2006-06-09|<p>Our protagonist is at the height of his career. Fairly fresh out of college, he is working in San Francisco with a company which other companies contract in to organize their downsizing (this is the height of the dot-com boom), and he is good at what he does. His girlfriend is beautiful, if dependant upon him financially. And then he gets hit by a car and suffers a concussion. He hopes to recover quickly, but he's not quite as oriented as he might like. He quickly loses his job and girlfriend, and then must sort through his life and what is important. Fortunately, his downstairs neighbor is an East German post-doctoral student with a bit of an eye out for him. It helps, when many of the suggestions that come his way for recovery are fruity new age scams.</p><p>This is a rather funny film with that touching, if expected, side about finding yourself. I guess what makes it better is the fact that the director/writer/lead actor actually experienced it himself. He was in the audience and answered questions after the film. The film also ends up being a bit of a critique of business and society. It shows a bit of the character of San Francisco as well, with several new age devotees to poke fun at.</p><p>The film is available on DVD, though it may be hard to track down. It's worth watching, though, if you like independent films. Although the director is Korean American, there's very little about the film that exclude the non-Korean audience.</p>
80618|silmido|DVD at home|2006-05-26|<p>In the 1960s, the KCIA decides to train a group of men to carry out an assassination against North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung. Because they intend to abandon the men and claim no responsiblity for the action, the men are pulled from prisoners who are set to be executed. These men are given the choice of execution or a chance to be a \"hero.\" But after their training, the political tides start to change.</p><p>This story is based on a real-life incident, Silmido being the name of the island where the men were trained. The bulk of the film is their training, which is extremely brutal. Although the film avoids some obvious political discussion, it does end up addressing issues - whether consciously or not is another question. To me, the decision by the latest batch of politicians is just as damning as the decision to create the unit in the first place. Outside of this, it is really a story of comraderie and betrayal, which history as an irrelevant backdrop.</p><p>This film broke box-office records in South Korea and I think that some of that is well earned. This isn't must-see cinema, but I would say it is worthwhile for fans of Korean film.</p>
80619|theunforgiven|Mann Festival Theatre, Westwood|2006-06-27|<p>In South Korea, two years of military service is mandatory for all males. After finishing school, Seung-Young enters the service and soon discovers that one of his superiors went to junior high school with him. This quickly leads to some preferential treatment, though they are careful not to let anyone know that it is because of their having gone to school together. But the absurd regimentation of army life just doesn't jive with someone whose been educated to treat things on a rational basis. For example, why get shoes for a senior soldier when they feet are practically in them already? When his senior friend finishes his two years, things change a bit, and the pressures increase without his protection and when Seung-Young is now required to boss others around. On leave, he visits Tae-Jeong but isn't able to reveal his problems and concerns.</p><p>This isn't an uplifting film in the least. It really is trying to portray Korean military life for those who aren't career soldiers, and that is necessarily a criticism of that system. Apparently this film was attacked in Korea because of this. Our protagonist, of course, only engages is passive resistance and doesn't really come to terms with how to deal with his two years. The best scene in the film for me was actually when he was visiting his senior while on leave and Tae-Jeong lays out his way of dealing with things &ndash; to just accept it and then put it all behind you when you are out. I think this is a common approach that many soldiers use in every country to cope with the military, whether at war or simply going through training.</p><p>This is a harsh film, and I don't know that I'd recommend it to anyone. I guess if you are interested in the subject matter and have a taste for slow-moving, independent films then this is worthwhile. The subject matter will make you think, but for me there are a lot of unexplored avenues that could have been touched upon.</p>
80620|wrestlinggrounds|Mann Festival Theatre, Westwood|2006-06-28|<p>Nalla is aided by a man when a gang is chasing him to rob him. This man turns out to be a wrestler, and Nalla is soon invited to train with him. At the head of the training area is a wrestler who is one of the best in the country. Nalla enjoys wrestling and is learning more about his own culture through it, but his mother is set against it. Another man is a gambler who cannot keep up with his debts. This ends up pulling him into a life of petty crime that slowly escalates as time goes on.</p><p>This film definitely does not stick to Hollywood traditions of storytelling. There are certainly dangling subplots that are left hanging at the end of the film. The sum total, though, is an interesting picture of the Senegalese capital and life in that country. The conflict of spiritual and ritual against the tendency towards modern sport also weigh on the wrestling, with gambling and promotion vying to take over.</p><p>I enjoyed the film, though there was definitely not as much wrestling as I might have expected. It is much more a slice-of-life film, and if you are going to track this film down to watch it, it should be because you enjoy those kinds of films.</p>
80621|xmen3|AMC at South Bay Galleria|2006-06-04|<p>When a lab announces that it has a \"cure\" for the mutant gene, all hell breaks loose for the mutant community. With teenage problems running rampant, Rogue takes off in hope of receiving the treatment. The flip side of this, of course, is that with a \"cure\" the government has a major new weapon in its hands. And then Scott Summers disappears when Jean Grey rises from the lake where she was thought to have died. But the escaped Magneto makes a play for her, and in a confrontation with Professor X wins her over to the X-Men's detriment. Magneto is pulling together a brotherhood of mutants for what looks to me their last chance to make a stand before the government takes the upperhand.</p><p>This story pulls together two storylines from the comics, the Phoenix and <director>Joss Whedon's</director> recent stab in <strong>The Astonishing X-Men</strong>. Because of these stories, my expectations were high, which usually is a bad idea when going into a movie like this. That did turn out to be the case. There is way too much time here spent on fighting, and not enough time on character and plot development that would have really improved things. When Cyclops is killed, we just don't care. Jean Grey is extremely powerful, yet she is entirely wasted. Did Famke just not want a speaking role here? We don't really get the emotional feeling we ought to from the mutant cure, since &ndash; as pivotal as it is &ndash; it is just not presented enough to work. Angel is completely throwaway, despite his appearing on all the ads for the film. And in true Hollywood tradition, Magneto is just too flat and one-sided.</p><p>This is really just a film for those who've already watched the first two. I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't send a newbie in. Where the previous film did a lot of work to get you interested in the characters and story, this one just assumes you are already on board and doesn't work to earn your respect.</p>
80622|memoriesofmurder|DVD at home|2006-07-28|<p>In 1986, a small village finds the first victims of a serial killer who rapes his victims before mutilating them. When the local police aren't getting very far, a detective from Seoul comes in to see what he can add. The detectives don't get along so well, as the city slicker is apt to quickly disprove the witness who's currently being framed. But as the case wears on and nothing turns up, both detectives begin to change.</p><p>I'd heard about this for some time, and had been warned up front that it doesn't have a happy ending. This is based upon an actual set of murders that began in 1986. Because of the political situation at the time (the government fell in 1987, if I remember correctly), the resources weren't committed that might have been. Obviously, many aspects of this film are fictionalized, but it still present an interesting story of two detectives as they struggle with a case they cannot solve.</p><p>This is an interesting film to watch, and I'd recommend it. It isn't something that everyone should see, just something for those into Korean films.</p>
80623|301302|DVD at home|2006-07-20|<p>Two women become neighbors, one in room 301 and the other across the hall in 302. Much of the film ends up being flashback, as one neighbor is quizzed by the police about the whereabouts of the other woman. They are opposites. One is anorexic beyond belief as well as completely against sex. She lives as an author of articles for women's magazines. The other woman has just divorced her husband after several years. She was an ideal wife by traditional standards, but it still wasn't enough. Now, she takes up her neighbor as a cause, hoping to use her cooking skills to get her to eat.</p><p>I wasn't sure what to expect with this film, and it does indeed surprise. Some people have said they were repulsed by some pivotal events of the film, but I thought they fit in perfectly and weren't really presented in a disgusting or exploitative manner. If there is any flaw, it is that the anorexic woman is too unbelievable, for there is no way she would have survived as long as she has if you accept the conditions laid out. Their relationship is interesting, and the telling of each's story keeps you wonders what happened. The nudity is gratuitous, but otherwise it all fits into place.</p><p>This in an interesting film, though I'm not sure who to recommend it to. It is an art film, really, with a slightly popular edge to it. If you can take anything, conceptually, and want to see a film about two women and their interaction, check it out.</p>
80624|theendofsuburbia|DVD at home|2006-07-29|<p>This documentary first lays out the history of suburbs in the United States. Following the Second World War, there is a boom in housing that spreads out of the city with the notion of a life in the \"country.\" Along with this is a rise in cul-de-sacs, traffic problems, and isolation. As one commentator explains, it was the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of humanity. And, of course, it has all ridden on the back of expanding oil production. But, as many experts presented in the film claim, the world may be reaching peak oil as we speak. This notion is that there is a limit to how much oil can be extracted from the Earth, and past a certain point (a bell curve in the charts), oil production must necessarily decline as oil supplies shrink and it becomes more difficult to extract the oil that we do know is there.</p><p>The argument presented isn't new, as they explain that an scientist from the 50s predicted U.S. oil production to peak in the 1970s. They claim that this did indeed happen, and that if it weren't for the oil shocks of the 1970s then we would have hit peak oil for the world in the 1990s. One problem with the argument is that you only get one side of the picture. There are a number of scientists and oil analysts saying that peak oil is a problem, but we don't get anyone to balance it out. This, of course, isn't something you can expect from a movie that's advocating peak oil, but it comes across as so one-sided that it makes it that much harder to believe.</p><p>The real problem here, though, comes in their proposals. They completely ignore the role of the oil companies and their role in oil prices and production. The problem then isn't to address any problems with that system, but instead to steel ourselves against the \"inevitable\" changes to come so that we might accept them better as society collapses. On the issue of production, we have countries like Iran that haven't increased production since the 1970s despite sitting on what is expected to be the second largest reserve on the planet. Their argument ends up supporting the oil companies and their utterly inhuman policies ... we aren't supposed to question the record profits of the oil companies but instead we are supposed to accept the increasing squeeze on the economy by these oligarchs by completely rearranging the way we live. I actually agree with some of their proposals, like public-transit-centric housing that encourages and allows people to walk or take the train to everywhere they need to be on a regular basis, but this is missing the whole problem that needs to be addressed before these changes can really mean anything.</p><p>I don't recommend this documentary. It was interesting for some factoids throughout it, but what we really need is a fundamental questioning of our society ... more fundamental than they are proposing. If we don't change the way our economy works, i.e. that the oil companies and their companions run the world, there will not be room for nice transit-centric communities but only barbarism. The effect of their argument is to support the oil companies, and in fact the oil companies use the idea of peak oil against us.</p>
80625|boysofbaraka|DVD at friend's house|2006-08-14|<p>Baltimore MD has a special program in the public schools whereby twenty junior high school boys are selected each year to attend school in Kenya for two years. All expenses are paid for the \"at risk\" youth, and instead of the 25% graduation rate that would normally be expected for them, most of them would probably graduate from high school if they complete the program. This documentary follows one class of these students, focusing on a few of the boys and their families. We see what happens to them and how they change while in Kenya. We also get to see what happens when the program is canceled.</p><p>This is an interesting and touching documentary. You get to see a bit of what life is like for these boys before they enter the program. Through interviews, we get insight into how the boys think about their situation &ndash; something crucial because they do see and know what is going on around them and what their prospect are for the future. The school in Kenya isn't all that special, really, it simply separates them from a number of the everyday problems that they face back home. More importantly, they get attention &ndash; small class sizes and a number of instructors who follow their progress on an intimate basis. The real question at the end is why the program couldn't be continued elsewhere, even at home.</p><p>This is a good film, and I'd recommend it to people who are interested in issue like education, particularly education for inner-city children.</p>
80626|hisgirlfriday|DVD at home|2006-07-11|<p>Hildy used to be a star reporter, but after a hiatus and meeting a man who wants something else, she shows up at the newspaper to say goodbye to her former boss and ex-husband, Walter Burns. But Walter is more than a little coniving, and he quickly begins scheming to get Hildy to drop her idea of getting married and moving away. There's a man on death row set for execution in the next day. Hildy ends up going there to interview the inmate, who pleads his innocence. When a jail break appears to have happened, Hildy gets drawn in to the life of a reporter.</p><p>The classic films always require close attention, since the dialogue can be fast and furious and actually be relevant to the plot of the film. The premise is  a little absurd, but we're dealing with an excellent director and actors. I'm not actually familiar with many of Hawks' films, but I understand that this is pretty typical for him. There are plenty of laughs here.</p><p>I'd recommend this film, particularly if you like classic films. It isn't heavy in the least, with only a mild touch of politics.</p>
80627|sorum|DVD at home|2006-07-13|<p>Yong-Hyun moves into a new apartment building, and things aren't what they seem. The building is basically condemned and set to be demolished, so the rent is cheap. Sun-Yeong, down the hall, is abused by her husband. When Yong-Hyun returns from his job as a cab driver, he offers to take her home from work as well. When Sun-Yeong kills her husband, her new neighbor helps dispose of the body. Meanwhile, stories are surfacing of events that occurred in his apartment thirty years before that seem to be parallel to events that are happening now.</p><p>I wasn't sure what to expect with this film. It is listed as a horror film, and I haven't been all that impressed with the Korean horror films I've seen. It really wasn't scary by my standards, but weird and disturbing. It is also inconclusive, like Korean films are want to be. It is interesting to watch, however, and you get pulled in somewhat trying to figure out what is going on.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film, but like I hinted at, this isn't my genre. It wasn't horrible, it is just that at the end of the film I couldn't say that it had been worthwhile to watch.</p>
80628|theyesmen|DVD at friend's house|2006-08-17|<p>Two pranksters with a social conscience set out to show the real face of the WTO. They'd gotten their hands on the gwbush.com web address back in 1999 and used that to put up an imitation site that displayed actual facts about George W. Bush. From there, they were handed the gatt.org address to mimic the website of the WTO and display the realities of that organization. They soon started getting e-mail from the site requesting them to speak on different TV shows or at different conferences. This movie is about the pranks they end up pulling at each of those venues.</p><p>I remember the trailer for this looking funny, but not quite funny enough to go watch. The pranks they pull are somewhat creative and can tickle your funnybone from time to time, but in the end I wasn't laughing as much as I thought I would. In the end, I was thinking more about the people making the film. For example, where do they get their money and what do they do? They seem to be in quite advantaged positions, with a handful of friends also in the same boat. Their pranks do end up being immature, and I was surpised at how they weren't able to handle themselves that well when asked questions. I really thought there was room for some more incisive commentary even within the context they use.</p><p>Of course, in the end, what do they accomplish? They are working on the premise that other people are ignorant and that they are crusaders who will succeed if they educate people. This isn't the problem. Instead, there needs to be some basis for action. If the WTO is something to be opposed, there would need to be a groundwork and proposal that is completely missing here. I don't agree that this is what is needed, but I'd respect these guys more if they at least had that. There's the additional problem that the butt of the jokes are seemingly oblivious business people and government officials. In reality, these people seem to me to not be paying attention from the get-go, just busy with their own work.</p><p>I don't recommend this film. Its audience is the student \"radical\" and young liberals. Even if you fit into this category, I don't see anything here that's worth watching.</p>
80629|johnstownflood|The Johnstown Flood Museum, Johnstown PA|2006-08-24|<p>In order to supply water to the canal system, a damn was built above Johnstown, Pennsylvania, but at its completion, it was no longer needed since the railroad had superceded canal transport in the area. The owner pulled out pipes to sell for scrap then sold off the dam and the surrounding acreage to the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, a small group of the wealthiest men in America. They further compromised the damn by lowering it 2-3 feet and putting up a screen to prevent stocked game fish from escaping the lake. After heavy rains, the damn burt on May 31, 1889. The wave of water that followed destroyed the town of Johnstown, killing more than 2200 people. It was the worst \"natural\" distaster to date.</p><p>This award-winning documentary does a pretty good job of laying out the events leading up to the flood and following it. It uses only archival photos as well as some re-enactments, which help convey the sense of what happens. A more modern production could add in CGI to help demonstrate the effects of the flood, but given what was available, I think the film makers here do a good job.</p><p>This is a good documentary, and fairly short. This is an event that most people in the U.S. should be aware of, and those that can make it to the museum have a lot to gain.</p>
80630|palemale|DVD at home|2006-09-07|<p>In 1991, a red-tailed hawk came to Central Park and made it his home. Dubbed Pale Male because of his plumage, he surprised everyone when he built a nest along 5th Avenue and won a mate. It took a few years, but eventually they had chicks which hatched. The drama then became when the chicks would fledge. A community of people grew in Central Park who waited anxiously for each moment.</p><p>This is a pretty fun documentary, and it is put together in such a way that you really become interested in what will happen next. If I have any complaints, it would simply be that I want to learn more about the hawks.  You do pick up some along the way, though the director clearly isn't trying to convey too much more about hawks than what is needed to understand the uniqueness of Pale Male.  The people in the park are quite funny as well, and they provide some narration of their own.</p><p>I'd recommend this short film for anyone. As of September 2006, Pale Male is still there, with his fourth mate, and having sired nearly thirty children. The destruction and subsequent rebuilding of the nest took place after the film was made, but you can find out more info on that online.</p>
80631|princessbride|DVD at home|2006-09-09|<p>I'd been itching to watch this again for a while, so when we sat down to watch a film the other night I put this one in. It is truly amazing how well this film is put together. Everyone takes themselves as seriously as needed, and there is humor working on so many levels. Each actor does an excellent job, and the film is just structured perfectly. It is truly a timeless classic.</p>
80632|tsotsi|DVD at fianc&eacute;e's parents' house|2006-09-16|<p>Tsotsi has grown up alone in the slums outside Johannesburg and survives by what him and his small gang of friends can take from people. The murder of one of their victims leads to tension in the group, and Tsotsi severely beats up one of them and flees into the night. He comes across a woman in a wealthy neighborhood who has just stepped out of her running car. At gunpoint, he takes the car, shooting her when she tries to stop him. It isn't until later that he realizes that an infant is in the back seat.</p><p>I'd wanted to see this when I first heard about it playing at the Pan-African Film Festival.  Even when it got wider release because it was an Oscar contender (which it won), I didn't make it to the theater. But the film is certainly worthwhile, and an excellent example of a good film getting the rewards it deserves. The actors, particularly Chweneyagae, do a great job. You get a glimpse into life in South Africa, as well as seeing the way that the people at the bottom prey off of each other as well as on those truly well off.</p><p>I recommend the film. If I have any complaint, it is that it may be just a little too clean for a film of this subject matter.</p>
80633|huoyuanjia|The Bridge, Howard Hughes Plaza|2006-09-24|<p>Huo Yuanjia is expected to learn the classics, but his father refuses to teach him martial arts. After his father loses a match because he doesn't want to kill his opponent, young Huo gets beaten up and vows to never be beaten again. He trains on his own after stealing a training manual from his father.  Jump forward to adulthood, and Huo's father has died and he now has a young daughter. He also has made quite a name for himself by defeating every challenger that comes forward. But the expenses are piling up and his students are straining things further. His best friend urges him to do something for the good of China, but instead he gets into a feud to be the best fighter in all of Tianjin. When this bring death to his own family, he retreats in his misery.</p><p>Billed as Jet Li's final martial arts epic, it also works to heavily convey much of Jet Li's personal philosophy that has led to his decision not to do \"martial art\" films again. The plot here is fairly good, and does convey the moral lessons it seeks to teach. I think there could have been more emphasis on this philosophy, in fact, to frame the fighting.</p><p>The fights are plenty of fun, of course, as can be expected with Jet Li. The editing and shooting of those fights, however, is far from Li's best. There are many edits, back and forth, like one expects from an actor who cannot really fight and whose editor has to do the job for him. We are still seeing some amazing moves, but these aren't the long shots that really show off the abilities of an accomplished artist. This could be simply a sign that Jet Li has gotten older. It may have also been a choice of the director, hoping to sex up the fight scenes for an audience that doesn't appreciate them fully.</p><p>Seeing the movie inspired me to do a little research on the actual Huo. There isn't a lot of information available, but just a little reading shows how far into fantasy the movie is. Huo was one of many children, and he also had a number of children himself (the movie seems to convey a line of only children). The number and nature of the fights is skewed as well. It is actually interesting how the nature of his death uses the same myth portrayed by <actor>Bruce Lee</actor> in <movie>Fist of Fury</movie> and Jet Li in <a href=\"./rev_fistlegend.html\" title=\"Fist of Legend movie review\">Fist of Legend</a>. At the same time, the films philosophy counters what happens in those films.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed the film. It isn't Jet Li's best, but it is still a Jet Li film. I look forward to a special edition that also includes the cut scenes, which feature additional fights.</p>
80634|yasu|Laemmle Sunset 5 Theatre|2006-09-29|<p>Jang is a rather aggressive and angry detective whose clearly been pushed around the department as a disciplinary measure. Oh is a prosecutor looking to nail a mafia boss who has just gotten out of jail. Things are complicated when Jang's brother is murdered. This causes Jang and Oh to cross paths, eventually leading them to work together. But in the corruption of South Korean politics, it isn't so easy to catch a bad guy who is connected in all the right places.</p><p>Although some of the film is way over the top, it is still quite fun. Jang comes across as completely crazy, so you have to suspend your belief in what Korean police departments find acceptable behavior in an officer. The point the director/write is shooting for here, in any case, is how the corruption that these officers are facing turn them into beasts (a rough translation of the Korean title of the film). You do see it here. You get rewarded in all the ways you expect, but still get an interesting message in the film. I read someone else's complaints about the fighting, but I actually like it. Half the time it is sloppy and confused (like most people fighting), but then Jang will get in a clean kick that isn't textbook. Really, the worst part of the film was the bad dubbing over the Korean woman who's supposed to be singing a Jazz song in English ... it distracts from an otherwise excellent soundtrack.</p><p>I liked the film, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the formula &ndash; two \"cops\" with different personalities coming together to catch their man, both forced to change along the way. Sometimes the violence is excessive, but then there are some times when the violence just gratifies you.</p>
80635|tron|DVD at home|2006-10-26|<p>I purchased the 20th anniversary DVD of this film with the thought of researching a potential Halloween costume. It'll have to wait for next year, since it's going to take more time than I have right now. I've reviewed the movie <short=\"tron\">before</short>, and I don't have much to add to that. This version of the DVD is quite impressive; they put some serious effort into making it look good.</p>
80636|weddingcrashers|DVD at home|2006-10-29|<p>John and Jeremy spend their summers crashing weddings. This involves going to weddings, fitting in, and ending the night by sleeping with one of the wedding guests. They've been quite successful, and their next challenge looks to be the greatest yet: the marriage of the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury. But things go awry. John's target turns out to have a boyfriend, and Jeremy's target is psycho-clingy ... and they are both sisters to the bride. For John to seal the deal, they end up spending the weekend with the entire family.</p><p>I'd heard that this film was quite funny when it came out in the theaters, but it took a while for me to finally sit down and watch it. I got the \"uncorked\" version from my aunt, so I'm not sure how this one differs from the one release in theaters. In any case, it is quite funny. Things start to mellow out near the end, but that's to be expected as things move from the comedy aspect to the romantic aspect. There are still some nice elements near the end, though, that should keep you laughing. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn aren't exploring any new territory here, and their characters are similar in personality to other characters I've seen them play. That's OK, though, since the premise and the writing keep things flowing smoothly.</p><p>This is a pretty funny film, and if you haven't caught it yet, it is a good date movie. I do have to wonder, though, how many young men took this movie as a role model.</p>
80637|mrhandy|DVD at home|2006-11-01|<p>Hye-Jin gets her resignation accepted at a hospital in Seoul and is subsequently blacklisted in the entire city. Unable to find work, she moves to a small fishing village and opens a dental office there. Her pretentious, entitled attitude doesn't set well with the community, however. Quickly, Mr. Hong is showing up to help her out with everything, as he is the neighborhood jack-of-all-trades. He turns up constantly, filling in one day at the convenience store, filling in for an absent musician at a club another night.</p><p>I actually laughed a lot while watching this film, but that's the only thing really positive I can say.  The film isn't really that good. It boils down to the fact that you never develop any empathy for the characters, and there isn't really any romance between them until the very last scene of the film. The promotional material make much of the lead actresses attractive body, but there's nothing visually risque in this film. I actually found her to be quite unattractive from the neck up, with what looks like bad cosmetic surgery issues. The best personality in the film for me was actually the friend and assistant character, who makes some funny comments and has great facial expressions.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. It isn't the worst way you could spend your time, but at the same time, why watch a romantic comedy when you don't care that either person has a love life.</p>
80638|thehost|ArcLight Hollywood|2006-11-04|<p>In 2000, a large batch of toxic chemicals are dumped into the Han River from an American military base. Six years later, a creature resulting from this polution emerges from the water of the river and begins to feast on humans. One family, who runs a concession stand along the river, lose their daughter to the monster. But while in quarantine, they get a weak phone call from her, trapped in the sewer where the monster has left her for later consumption. They must then pool their resources to try and track her down before she dies as well.</p><p>This film now holds the records for ticket sales in South Korea, with something like a quarter of the entire population having seen the film. There's a good reason of it, since this film really appeals to a lot of people, in particular the young crowd that make up movie-goers. The monster is quite impressive, and there's only one time in the movie where the special effects fall through. You really do get a mix of monster movie, comedy, and family appeal here. For me, the film's failings lie in the areas that should have been expanded more. Of course, the film is already on the longer end of what you'd expect. I was surprised that I wasn't as emotionally moved by the family's actions, something I typically expect a Korean film to be able to do better than most. I did like that there were a number of political and social comments throughout the film, but none of them were heavy-handed.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to other people. It is set to be released in the U.S. in early 2007, and then remade into an American version probably in 2008 (not looking forward to that). This probably wouldn't be a bad introduction to Korean cinema for those who haven't seen any yet.</p>
80639|greatestexpectation|DVD at home|2006-11-13|<p>Chang-Shik is a deadbeat who lives with his brother and sister-in-law. He occasionally takes care of his son from a previous relationship. Mi-Yeong is something of a bum as well, working at her mother's video and book rental store for spare change. Both of them witness the hit-and-run death of an old man who jogs in the neighborhood. But then the people who hit the man don't want to be identified, so they track the two down. Meanwhile, the old man had a missing child who he never found and another son wealthy and interested in tracking down his long lost brother.</p><p>This is another Korean romantic comedy without the romance. I really enjoyed <strong>My Lovely Sam-Soon</strong>, so was interested in seeing the lead actress in another film. It is an interesting contrast, since she is indeed much skinnier here.  The film is definitely funny in parts, and I found myself laughing frequently enough. But the romance doesn't come together for me. In fact, the male lead is actually rather disturbing. He has an unsuccessful attempt at a date rape, as well as later getting some thrill out of watching Mi-Yeong as a captive.  When they seem to be getting together at the end, you really don't want anyone with this guy, he still have some civilizing to do.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film. It is funny enough, but the romance is more disturbing than anything else.</p>
80640|constantgardener|DVD at home|2006-11-19|<p>The wife of a British foreign service worker stationed in Kenya dies. The report is that her and her lover ran off the road, but the husband doesn't believe this. He'd always kept out of her business, so it takes some effort to track down what she was doing and why. It turns out she was involved in health aid to the local people and battling pharmaceutical companies there to run tests.</p><p>This was a fairly well constructed film with a social message that I didn't find heavy handed. The one complaint that I've heard about the film is that it pushes the whole love affair mystery and white-black issue too much, which I can kind of agree with, but this isn't the main thrust of the film and a savvy filmgoer will have seen beyond this by the time it happens in the film. The settings, all done in the areas of Africa that the story is actually taking place, are excellent, and do their own part to give an insight into life for people there.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to most. I enjoyed the acting and the story and think that most people will as well.</p>
80641|mywifeisagangster|fiancee's parents' house|2006-12-25|<p>A friend lent us this movie recently, and I was anxious to have Jiin see it, since it is one of the pivotal Korean comedies. We watched it together with her sister and father, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. One of the greats, and a must-see for anyone interested in Korean cinema.</p>
80642|sincity|DVD at home|2006-11-22|<p>Several stories converge here. A mammoth of a man wakes up next to a dead woman and immediately smells set-up. He flees before the cops can take him in, determined to track down who's behind it all. Another man accidentally kills a hero cop and has to struggle to keep his hooker friend from coming under the thumb of the underworld or drowning in a bloodbath. A cop with a bad heart and on the verge of retirement risks everything to save a little girl from one of the most powerful men in town.</p><p>I haven't read any of the <strong>Sin City</strong> comics and have really only read a little bit of Frank Miller's stuff ... <strong>Daredevil</strong> and <strong>Dark Knight Returns</strong> is all I recall. From what I'd seen of the trailers, I wasn't that interested in the film. But friend had recommended catching it, and I was able to borrow it from my aunt.</p><p>The visual style of the film is almost worth it alone. I wasn't sure from watching clips, but it really works for the film. They did some amazing stuff recreating the black-and-white scenes, and the single color additions work as well. They also do an incredible job of putting together the characters, since some of them are rather cartoony but still come across as believable (well, within limits). The story isn't all that amazing, and there's no women's lib to be found here. Just the opposite, there are plenty of women to look at simply for the sheer carnal joy of it.</p><p>I enjoyed the film, though I'm not sure how much I'd recommend it. If you are into the comic books, then you've probably already seen it. If not, then the reason to see it is for the visuals, which the story and characters hold up well enough to make it a pleasant ride.</p>
80643|vforvendetta|DVD at home|2006-11-17|<p>In a fascist, future Britain, an anarcho-terrorist known only as V begins carrying out provocative acts. He starts by blowing up a building on the evening of Guy Falkes Day. Soon, he has taken over the emergency TV network and broadcast his message calling people to gather at the next Guy Falkes Day to watch Parliament blown up and see the final downfall of the current regime. Evy gets involved when V saves her from rape and murder at the hands of the government-backed militia. She then helps him during his escape from the TV station. As the cops cannot track him down, the effect of his actions spread.</p><p>I'd read the comic book only recently, a friend having lent it to me. I liked it, though I found it somewhat immature artistically (and rightfully so). I also found that it was an appropriate comic book subject, since V is very much a super hero in a classic sense. That's probably what put me off most about the story, the notion that this single person's actions were changing everything. I would have enjoyed it more had there been more involvement from a larger cast of characters or even by the masses of people. In any case, I did enjoy it enough to be interested in watching the film.</p><p>I found the film better in some ways and worse in others. From a story-telling point of view, I enjoyed the comic better. I liked the building up of the story and the focus through the detectives and their discovery of what was going on. The movie ends up skipping over the bulk of this. The movie, on the other hand, does tighten up some of the story and help make sense of things that seem to ramble in the book. I actually found the politics in the movie to be a bit cleaner; even if I didn't agree with them exactly, they made more sense. I found V to be much more absurd and super-powered in the movie, which I didn't like. I also though the passing of the torch to Evy wasn't as clear as it needed to be, and the whole romantic inclinations were not necessary and confused this issue.</p><p>I enjoyed the film, but I'd only recommend it to people who either read the book or have taken a fancy to the subject matter already. It isn't that impressive that I'd recommend it beyond that.</p>
80644|northcountry|DVD at home|2007-01-06|<p>Josey takes her two kids and flees her husband after a bout of domestic violence. While staying with her parents, it is suggested to her to get a job in the mine. Although thought of as men's work, the mine did start taking in women in recent years as a result of the changes of the 70s. The money is good, about four times better than anything else in town. But Josey quickly sees the sexual harassment that takes its toll on every women working there. When she cannot take it anymore, she seeks help in suing the company for harassment.</p><p>There were a couple things that turned me off of this movie when there were running the trailers. First of, it wasn't clear that this wasn't just another Hollywood movie glossing over the situation of workers. Second, I'm always a little put off by highly attractive actresses playing parts that are supposed to be average people. Friends who saw it, however, convinced me that the movie was still worth watching, and they were not wrong.</p><p>The characters in the film, starting with Josey, are actually conglomerations of actual people. From the get-go, the movie feels quite real, and at no point do you feel that this couldn't possibly have happened. Everyone here is talented, and it shows in their performances. Thematically, the film does do a good job of addressing the harassment issue and showing how it really worked against women in the working class. This was refreshing, since most images of harassment are of fairly privileged women, typically middle class or better off. I didn't feel that any party is made a saint or the bad guys demonized, again something I find refreshing and rare in Hollywood treatments.</p><p>I'd definitely recommend this film. If you rent the DVD, by all means watch the documentary that includes interviews with the actual people involved in the case (hint, they don't look like Theron). My favorite line is when one of the supporting actresses admits that life would be harder for her if it hadn't been for the women who fought back in the mines of the North Country. This is a lesson that everyone can learn from, in an age when people blatantly ignore or are unaware of the sacrifices that others have made before them to allow them the privilege of ignore that advantage.</p>
80645|akeelahandthebee|DVD at fiancee's parents' house|2006-11-24|<p>Akeelah's father had got her interested in word, and she continues to enjoy word games and express an impressive vocabulary for a girl her age. When the school has a spelling bee, she is coaxed into participating and wins easily. This leads to further competition at the district level. A local professor offers to help her, but Akeelah is resistant to what he has to offer. When she makes it to the next level, she realized that she will need more that her own knowhow to really succeed.</p><p>It's usually a safe assumption that a film with Angela Bassett in it is going to be good, and this one was no exception. There are not real surprises here, it is a feel-good film about an underdog overcoming adversity, and we all know that coming in. But the acting is superb all around, especially by the young woman playing Akeelah. The story develops enjoyably, and the other characters add to the charm and levity of the film.</p><p>I'd recommend this to just about anyone. It isn't a must see film, but if you like this genre of film, it is certainly a good specimen.</p>
80646|seeyouafterschool|fiancee's parents' house|2006-12-16|<p>Namgung Dal is a consummate loser. He took a year off to go into a special program for loser kid, and even the other losers thought he was a loser. Back at a new school for the first time, he hopes to make a fresh start, but invariably makes all the wrong moves. Trying to step into a fight, he ends up with an appointment to meet the biggest bully after school. He then spends the rest of the day trying to figure out a way out of the fight without losing face or his life.</p><p>This was a remarkably funny film, certainly funnier than I was expecting. You know the general direction the film is going to head, but you are surprised along the way at how the protagonist gets into the situations he's in. There's no attempt at much realism here, the situations and characters are absurd from the beginning, but that's just the kind of film it is. The only negative thing I heard about the film was the complaint that the actors are obviously not high-school aged. This didn't bother me, since that's not all that uncommon.</p><p>I'd definitely recommend this among most of the Korean comedies I know. Korean comedies haven't been doing all that well in the past few years, and it is nice to see someone producing something worth watching.</p>
80647|blazingsaddles|DVD at home|2006-12-07|<p>Certain interests are hoping to make a killing off of the construction of a railroad, but a small town stands in the way. On the cusp of execution, our hero is assigned as the new sheriff of the town. The plan is that they'll reject him, a black man, and it will only help further the vacating of the town. Through trials, though, the new sheriff is able to pull the town together.</p><p>I'm not sure if I'd ever seen this in its entirety, so I figured it was worth watching again. Some of the humor is dated, but the playing off of racial stereotypes still works today. It really is fascinating how much Brooks was able to push the envelope here. Brooks' style isn't exactly my favorite, but I still find it enjoyable. I don't get into the who meta-filming bit at the end, and that leaves a worse impression for me than the film really ought to.</p><p>This doesn't really seem like a film I have to recommend. If you somehow aren't familiar with Mel Brooks, then this is probably the best of his films.</p>
80648|volver|Laemmle Royal Theater|2006-11-25|<p>Raimunda's parents passed away in a fire several years before, and she and her sister occassionally visit their aunt, who talks as if their mother were still alive. Her sister, Sole, is single and supports herself through doing cosmetology in her apartment. Raimunda takes advantage of a situation to start up a business of her own, but her daughter and her have to deal with the sudden \"disappearance\" of her husband as well.</p><p>Even after watching a trailer, I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. Now that I've seen it, it is hard to describe in a manner that is enticing yet doesn't give away some of the elements that make the film really fun. It turned out to be very enjoyable, funny and serious at all the right times. It is impressive to see a movie that essentially contains no men. At the same time, despite being a film about female relationships, it isn't a \"chick flick\" that's sappy and overly sentimental. I think it is the absurd elements of the film that help pull this off. Everything ends up believable, as well, which is impressive given the situations.</p><p>I'd certainly recommend this film. Although I haven't seen any Pen&egrave;lope Cruz films before this that I can recall, I didn't have that favorable of an impression of her as an actress. That's completely changed now.</p>
80649|thepromise|DVD at fiancee's parents' house|2006-11-23|<p>A small girl promises to be another boy's slave, but then quickly escapes from him when the opportunity arises. After dropping her food in the water, though, a goddess comes to her and gives her beauty and the admiration of every man, but on the condition that anyone she loves is doomed to death. We jump forward many years, and she has fallen for a man then leaves her after having saved her life. A love triangle is developed here, since she only knows the man by his armor and mask, when it was in fact the slave of the owner of the armor.</p><p>This movie was hard to follow, and there were aspects of it that didn't fit into place until the end. I'm not sure how much of this is by design and how much of this is because of translation, though I suspect the former. In any case, I never developed much empathy for the characters, particularly not the female lead. The color and cinematography are amazing, but that does not a movie make. The supposed fighting that takes place here has also really evolved beyond the wuxia of the 90s that was actually enjoyable to watch. Instead, it is just filler material to build up the absurd plot.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. I didn't find the romance compelling, and the fantasy elements were just too overdone. The huge budget appears to have gotten in the way of making a good film.</p>
80650|munich|DVD at home|2007-01-19|<p>During the Munich Olympics of 1972, eight Palestinians break into the Israeli dormitory and take a number of players and coaches hostage. The incident led to the deaths of eleven Israelis and five of the Palestinians. In Israel, Avner is a non-descript member of the Mossad. He is approached by top-ranking officials and asked to take on a special mission. In secret, and disconnected from any Israeli ties, he leads a team of five people into Europe with the task of tracking down and assassinating eleven people the Israeli government says were instrumental in planning Black September.</p><p>From what I understand, the Munich portion of the film is quite true to history, even pulling a few punches where some further information has actually come to light since the incident. After that, the films steps into historical fiction. In reality, the assassinations were actually carried out by active Mossad agents, and not by some untrained and disowned group of ex-Mossad. The sequence of events does follow history, although I missed that Ehud Barak reference while I was watching the film (the future Prime Minister leads the Lebanon attack in the movie and in reality).</p><p>Historical accuracy aside, this is an excellent movie. I'm not a Spielberg fan and typically shun his films, but there is no denying that he can make a good quality film with talented actors. I was most impressed by the relative neutrality of the film. Although all the principle characters are Israeli, their situation is shown in a broad enough light that the viewer can draw their own conclusions, or better yet, begin to ask their own questions. A Palestinian does get a voice for a brief scene in the film to add a little texture, but the film isn't concerned so much with anything that happened before Munich to incite Black September or account for how the Israeli state came into existence. I could see the humanist, pacifism that I understand Spielberg subscribes to, but he does himself credit as a filmmaker by not pushing that line in a heavy-handed manner.</p><p>I recommend this film to all. I didn't really know anything about Black September or the Munich Olympics before watching the film, and it inspired me to do a little reading on my own to better understand what happened. On top of that, the film does an excellent job of just looking at the question of terrorism and the toll it takes on those who carry it out, exploring the different factors that come out of the event.</p>
80651|thegoodthebadandtheugly|DVD at home|2007-03-11|<p>It actually took us three nights to get through this, since it was the three hour extended version which was released not too long ago. I only noticed a few scenes that I hadn't seen before, particularly because the sound quality was sometimes worse on those segments. The restoration was good, and the sound quality was excellent, an important feature with a film that has one of the best soundtracks ever. My fiance hadn't seen it before, and she enjoyed the film as well. I'm always happy to watch what I consider to be one of the best films ever.</p>
80652|lastkingofscotland|AMC 14 Theaters, Century City|2007-02-19|<p>Nicholas Garrigan graduates from medical school and, desperate to be free of his father, picks a point on the globe and goes. It ends up being Uganda, just as Idi Amin is coming to power. For a while he works as a doctor in the countryside, helping people who have very little but shamanistic practice to handle their health problems. Nicholas is young and brash, of course, and anxious to bed with any women he can. Soon, however, he crosses paths with Amin, and before he knows it, he is the ruler's personal physician. This has its perks, but as he ends up playing an advisory role to the fickle dictator, there is a great deal of stress and tension as well. As the stakes mount, it quickly becomes too late for him to simply walk away.</p><p>Whitaker definitely deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Amin in this film. You do get a more sympathetic impression of Amin than I would expect from a western film. I was left wanting to know more, though, since Amin did stay in power for over 8 years and the film doesn't convey a sense of the popularity that he retained even after the initial rise. In the end, this is a film about the personal relationship between Amin and the doctor, and not about the history of Uganda. Because the doctor is young and naive, the viewer also is left with scarce historical context. I understand why the film does this, but I wanted more. One last note, this film is loosely based on the life and memoirs of an actual person, though the real-life doctor definitely did not leave with hands as clean as our protagonist's.</p><p>Definitely one of the better films of the year, I'd recommend this to most. If you are a person who wants to know more about history, though, make sure you do some research on your own before or after watching the film, because it isn't in here.</p>
80653|littlemisssunshine|DVD at work|2007-02-22|<p>Young Olive has won a chance to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in Redondo Beach, California, but when the news comes, it is a little too late and money is a little too short for the family to fly out from Albuquerque, New Mexico. They have the uncle, a preeminent Proust scholar who has just survived a suicide attempt, to watch after. The grandfather has been kicked out of his retirement community. And the teenage brother hasn't spoken a work in well over six months in his commitment to becoming a pilot &ndash; as well as to avoid talking to his dysfunctional family. The father has invested all their money into a self-help program that has yet to gain any attention.</p><p>This funny film is really about a family sticking together when the chips are down. Alan Arkin puts in an excellent performance, for which he deservingly won an Oscar and which keeps you laughing through much of the film. My biggest complain of the film was that I kept thinking they were in L.A. already, since whenever they were eating, it seemed to be at or from a restaurant within a few miles of where I work. That's just one of those problems of living in L.A., I guess. The glimpse into, and accompanying critique of, the underage beauty pageant is poignant and an excellent end to the film.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to anyone who wants something funny that's pretty light. In the end, the story is a bit too contrived to convey a more heartfelt message, but that's OK.</p>
80654|thenamesake|Monica 4-Plex|2007-03-11|<p>As a\nyoung man in India, Ashoke is traveling by train to see his grandfather, reading\nGogol and talking to another passenger. That passenger encourages him to get out\nand see the world, and when the train wrecks, Ashoke makes the leap. Two years\nlater, he is back in India to meet his prospective bride, who he takes back to\nNew York City to finish his graduate studies. Five years later, they are moving\nto the suburbs with their young son Gogol. Jumping ahead, Gogol graduates from\nhigh school, now angry at the name his father gave him and looking to break from\nhis family.</p><p>As a whole, this is a film about the immigrant experience and\nthe second generation that grows up here with a cultural heritage that is hard\nto understand and keep any hold on. I found the father and mother to be as\nimportant characters as the son, Gogol, though he is - in the end - the main\nprotagonist. This is not a film of action or even plot, so much, but of\nexperience and going through life. From beginning to end, we cover perhaps 32 or\n33 years of time. We know, as viewers, what is coming in the end, but seeing it\nunravel is worth the watch.</p><p>I'd recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the subject. You get a bit of Bengali culture, and you get an insight into what it means to be an immigrant as well as what it can mean to be an American.</p>
80655|finishingthegame|Sundance Film Festival|2007-01-25|<p>Bruce Lee died in 1973 and left 12 minutes of footage for his own passion project, <strong>Game of Death</strong>. This \"documentary\" follows what happened next, as the producer looks to find the replacement for Bruce Lee. The auditions in Los Angeles pull in a wide variety of people, from an already established star to a half-Chinese guy who looks fresh out of Ireland. On top of this, the director and the casting director seem to have different goals in mind for the replacement. As the people narrow down to the final few, it still isn't clear how it's all going to come together.</p><p>This hilarious film is a must-see for any fan of the martial arts genre, Bruce Lee, or Asian-American cinema. It isn't a mockumenatry, since it is not attempting to make fun of the documentary genre. Instead, it is using the medium of an imagined documentary to tell a fun story. The whole idea would be patently absurd if it wasn't for the fact that the real <strong>Game of Death</strong> was indeed filmed with only a few minutes of footage of Bruce Lee, the rest done with a stand-in that is clearly not Bruce. The film does touch on subjects such as what it means to be Chinese-American, but the main focus is the laughs.</p><p>Highly recommended, I hope that this film gets some circulation in the theaters before it hits DVD.</p>
80656|whitelightblackrain|Sundance Film Festival|2007-01-26|<p>This documentary tells the story of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but through interviews with the people who survived. More than a dozen survivors are interviews, including a Korean woman who was in Japan when it happened. U.S. soldiers who were on the planes also recount the events of August 1945.</p><p>This is a must-see documentary, and I think it should be shown to every high school student in the country. It isn't an easy film to watch, of course. I can be fairly certain that no one left the theater without shedding a few tears; the imagery and interviews are hard. We not only get a glimpse at the events of those days, but also at the emotional and physical trials the survivors had to go through in the years since. Some of this has been portrayed elsewhere, but this is apparently the first U.S. documentary to do so. An excellent part of the documentary is the interviews with one of the men on the plane. Unlike the others, who have developed a (reasonable) coping strategy of just not dealing with the events on anything but a superficial level, one of the men sees beyond that to the human cost.</p><p>I cannot reiterate enough how much I think people should see this documentary. I think it is set to show in theaters soon, which is a good thing, but it really needs a wider distribution in the education system to provide a human counterbalance to the dogs of war so vocal these days.</p>
80657|darkmatter|Sundance Film Festival|2007-01-27|<p>In 1991, a Chinese student comes to do his graduate studies in cosmology in the U.S., working with one of the preeminent scholars in the world. But as he begins to study, he sees the faults in his professor's model; faults which can be explained by the presence of dark matter. But the professor is more interested in promoting himself, and he views his graduate students a some many intelligent worker bees to further his own aims. If it weren't for a few local philanthropists, the Chinese students would not even get much exposure to the world around them. And when our protagonist does not conform to the wishes of his advisor, things are certain to come to a head.</p><p>The events of this movie were inspired by an actual event in the early 1990s. The movie does an excellent job of portraying what it is like to be a graduate student in the U.S. (I cannot vouch for elsewhere). If anything, it's failing might be that it implies that this sweatshop approach to academics is because the students are Chinese, when in fact homegrown scholars get the same treatment when they go for their PhDs.</p><p>I liked this movie a lot up until the final scenes. The building up of the story through Chinese traditional cosmology was a nice touch, and the actors do an excellent job. But the ending comes across a little too clean. In all honestly, a good minute or two could be cut, and the movie would still be top-notch.</p><p>Word was that this film might be screened in mainland China, as well. I'm not sure if it got picked up for U.S. distribution, but it wouldn't ever get anything more than arthouse screenings. It deserves that much, and it is a movie I would recommend with only some reservation.</p>
80658|animationspotlight2007|Sundance Film Festival|2007-01-27|<p><a href=\"http://festival.sundance.org/2007/watch/film.aspx?which=810&category=AN\" title=\"'One Rat Short' short at sundance.org\">One Rat Short</a> was definitely a favorite among those I saw this with. It is a simple, romantic tale about a rat who has the misfortune of making into an animal lab by unusual means. The computer animation is excellent, and the story works.</p><p><a href=\"http://festival.sundance.org/2007/watch/film.aspx?which=795&category=AN\" title=\"'Duct Tape and Cover' short at sundance.org\">Duct Tape and Cover</a> is an excellent combination of political and funny. It merges 50s audio and documentary clips with a flash animation style to effectively convey a witty jab at the government.</p><p><a href=\"http://festival.sundance.org/2007/watch/film.aspx?which=812&category=AN\" title=\"'Phantom Canyon' short at sundance.org\">Phantom Canyon</a> was hard to follow. It involved insects and bat wings and some other stuff, all told through the medium of old artwork in a cut and paste presentation. Bound to put you to sleep if you aren't hyped up on caffeine or worse.</p><p><a href=\"http://festival.sundance.org/2007/watch/film.aspx?which=794&category=AN\" title=\"'Destiny Manifesto' short at sundance.org\">Destiny Manifesto</a> has the problem of being too artistic for its own good. The message comes across very quickly, and then it gets repeated over and over. I appreciate the political message, but in the middle of a long day, it put me to sleep.</p><p><strong>Golden Age</strong> was a riot, mixing a variety are artistic styles to infuse life into a number of almost characters from advertising, TV, and more. This was definitely the biggest laugh-getter.</p><p><strong>Paulina Hollers</strong> was an animators' film, meaning that it was done to appeal to other animators but really has litle appeal to the average viewer ... art for art's sake for lack of a better term. The story was hard to follow, and to me the style was kind of grating. It reminded me of graduation films I'd seen from CalArts, written by students who were too wrapped up in themselves and their \"art\".</p><p><strong>Dreams and Desires &ndash; Family Ties</strong> was a funny short that was original in its approach and honesty. The point of view and the limited fleshing out of visual details was a good change, though somewhat reminiscent of Bill Plympton to me. Because of the story was off-beat, it was fun to watch even while it isn't saying anything all that new.</p><p><strong>Everything Will Be OK</strong> was not only my personal favorite, but the winner of the animation short award. Some of the ideas are just completely off-the-wall, but still possible to relate to. Sometimes the art, which is primarily emotive stick figures, gets a little more artsy than it needs to be, but it does it with a purpose that adds to the story being presented.</p>
80659|shortsprogramiii2007|Sundance Film Festival|2007-01-27|<p><a href=\"http://festival.sundance.org/2007/watch/film.aspx?which=790&category=SF\" title=\"'Cubs' short at sundance.org\">Cubs</a> follows some British youths as they take part in their first fox hunt, though this is a new, urban reinterpretation of the aristocratic pasttime. The short was well shot, but I felt like I really needed to know something more about the fox hunt controversy to really get the film.</p><p><a href=\"http://festival.sundance.org/2007/watch/film.aspx?which=824&category=SF\" title=\"'The Tube with a Hat' short at sundance.org\">The Tube with a Hat</a> won the award for international short. It was quite well done, although it takes a while tounderstand what the title is really about. I enjoyed the short, though I wouldn't have selected it as the best. You do get a wonderful little slice of life for a poor family in Romania.</p><p><strong>BITCH</strong> is pure fun. We start of with a woman sitting on a bench with a roller skater circling around. She makes short work of him. It then turns into a love story that's not your ordinary feminist work.</p><p><a href=\"http://festival.sundance.org/2007/watch/film.aspx?which=818&category=SF\" title=\"'The Grass Grows Green' short as sundance.org\">The Grass Grows Green</a> was a slow, but excellent look at life for a military recruiter in the time of an unpopular war. The acting was excellent, and several of us would have selected it as our favorite dramatic short.</p><p><a href=\"http://festival.sundance.org/2007/watch/film.aspx?which=788&category=SF\" title=\"'Bomb' short as sundance.org\">Bomb</a> was interesting to me, but I think that's because I could relate to it more than the people I was with. In the end, it isn't that moving of a short, where it really needs to be to win over more people. At the same time, I cannot think of anything I'd change.</p><p><a href=\"http://festival.sundance.org/2007/watch/film.aspx?which=820&category=SF\" title=\"'The Substitute' short as sundance.org\">The Substitute</a> was another fun short, about a substitute teacher to a class of teenagers who is willing to point out their foibles and play off their insecurities in a way that doesn't come across of fully mean-spirited. And then the surprise comes in and it is that much better and funnier.</p>
80660|eaglevsshark|Sundance Film Festival|2007-01-28|<p>Lily isn't the most popular woman at work, or anywhere for that matter, but she's a realist when it comes to herself. She has her eye on a guy who comes into her fast food restaurant like clockwork. When he invites another woman at the joint to a party he is throwing, she takes advantage of the opportunity to go herself. Dressing up as her favorite animal (the theme of the party), she quickly wins his attention. But can their relationship go the distance?</p><p>There is so much to like about this film. Where the joke of <short=\"napoleondynamite\">Napoleon Dynamite</short> got old for me after the first 30 minutes, similar types of characters here make it work for the whole film. I think the female, realistic perspective helps. Just when you think you've been surprised, the film tops itself. At the same time that your jaw is dropping in disbelief, you realize that what you just saw is completely in character.</p><p>This was hands-down our favorite film of the Festival. I'm glad to see that it will be distributed nationwide later in the year, and I will very likely purchase it on DVD when it becomes available. It is an excellent choice as a date movie.</p>
80661|mushishi|Sundance Film Festival|2007-01-27|<p>In an earlier Japan, bugmasters travel the countryside, curing people of the ailments that come from concentrated \"bugs\". Some travel for research, learning of the new and different bugs that are around. These bugs are not insects, but some kind of spirit-world manifestation, visible only to a select few, though their effects can sometimes be seen by others. Ginko is searching for answers of his own when he returns to Tanyu, a crippled bugmaster who captures mushi by locking them in scrolls. Her bugs escape, and Ginko learns something about himself as well as working to save Tanyu.</p><p>This film is rather stunning visually, and I was truly impressed by the seamless intermingling of the mushi with the real world. I never got a sense that this was a complete fantasy, the way that some jarring CGI painfully reminds you. The story unfolds slowly. The viewer, however, should enjoy the trip as they learn more and more about this mysterious world that the director has brought to life.</p><p>I'm not sure whether this film is slated to become available to audiences here in the U.S., but it is worth watching for those with a taste for the fantastic. The film isn't message-heavy, just an enjoyable journey.</p>
80662|voiceofamurderer|MPark 4 Theater|2007-04-06|<p>Han Kyung-bae is one of the most successful television reporters in the country, finishing the 9 o'clock news every day with an editorial that is attentively listened to. His son is more than a little pudgy, and his wife works their son hard in the hopes of getting him to lose a little weight. But then their son is kidnapped, and their lives are put on hold so that they are at the beck and call of the kidnapper, who calls them periodically to threaten them and demand ransom. Although they comply and provide the money, the police are unable to track him down and their son is not returned</p><p>This movie is based upon a real kidnapping case from 1991. In a lot of ways, it feels like the movie <short=\"memoriesofmurder\">Memories of Murder</short>, which is also based upon a crime for the 1980s that remains unsolved. Apparently the statute of limitations in Korean is about 15 years, because it is mentioned at the end of this film and would nicely coordinate with when <strong>Memories</strong> was made in relation to the crimes it depicts. Unlike <strong>Memories</strong>, which concentrates on the detectives, this film concentrates on the parents as their lives fall apart. I was not moved that emotionally by the film, and the sense of suspense never built up for me. Maybe this was because I knew from the synopsis I'd read how the situation was going to end. Maybe it was because I just couldn't related to the horror of the situation these people were going through.</p><p>In the end, I cannot recommend this film. It isn't horribly made, but for the genre I would recommend <strong>Memories</strong> first.</p>
80663|sway|MPark 4 Theater|2007-04-14|<p>Takeru is a successful photographer living in Tokyo. He returns to his hometown for the first anniversary of his mother's death. When he stops for gas at the family gas station, he sees that his childhood friend Chieko is now working there. His father hired her on with the intent of pushing her and Takeru's brother Minoru together. The next day, the two brothers and Chieko go to a scenic gorge together. While Takeru has walked off to take photographs, Chieko and Minoru end up on the bridge spanning a gorge, and Chieko plunges to her death. Within days, Minoru is arrested for murder, and Takeru must battle with what he remembers from that day.</p><p>This film has won awards at different festivals for both best director and screenplay. After watching it, it's easy to see that the awards are well deserved. The film is so well shot; I was marveling at the camerawork a number of times. The shots are well framed and full of meaning that sometimes doesn't come together until later. The relationships between the different characters are portrayed expertly. There is enough presented that no one feels flat or meaningless. This film is also a discussion film. There are definitely questions left at the end of the film, both about what happened and about human memory and fault.</p><p>I definitely recommend this film. I is thought-provoking and a pleasure to watch, even if the subject matter is a little on the heavy side.</p>
